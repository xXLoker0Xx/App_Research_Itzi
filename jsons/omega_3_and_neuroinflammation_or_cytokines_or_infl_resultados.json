In a double-blind, randomized, and crossover study, females (n = 16) and males (n = 23) aged 30-70 years with abdominal obesity were supplemented with 3-4 g/d EPA/DHA (fish oil) or 15-20 g/d LA (safflower oil) for 7 weeks, with a 9-week washout phase. Cytokines and chemokines (multiplex assay), acute-phase proteins (MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry), endothelial function (vascular reaction index), blood pressure, FA composition (red blood cell membranes/serum/adipose tissue, GC-MS/MS), and adipose gene expression (microarrays, quantitative PCR) were measured. While significant differences between treatments in relative change scores were found for systolic blood pressure (n-3 vs. n-6: -1.81% vs. 2.61%, P = 0.003), no differences between n-3 and n-6 were found for any circulatory inflammatory markers. However, compared with baseline, n-3 was followed by reductions in circulating TNF (-24.9%, P < 0.001), regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (-12.1%, P < 0.001), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-beta (-12.5%, P = 0.014), and n-6 by lowered TNF (-18.8%, P < 0.001), regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (-7.37%, P = 0.027), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (-7.81%, P = 0.020), and macrophage inflammatory protein 1-beta (-14.2%, P = 0.010). Adipose tissue showed significant treatment differences in weight percent of EPA (n-3 vs. n-6: 50.2%∗ vs. -1.38%, P < 0.001, ∗: significant within-treatment change score), DHA (16.0%∗ vs. -3.67%, P < 0.001), and LA (-0.033 vs. 4.91%∗, P < 0.001). Adipose transcriptomics revealed overall downregulation of genes related to inflammatory processes after n-3 and upregulation after n-6, partly correlating with changes in circulatory markers. These data point to tissue-specific proinflammatory effects of high n-6 intake, but a net systemic anti-inflammatory effect as for n-3."

Secondary analysis of the MAPT longitudinal data. MAPT is a randomized, placebo-controlled trial with 3 interventional groups (omega-3 only, MI only, omega-3 plus MI) and a control group. We tested the association of the change in cognitive function with inflammatory biomarkers (tumoral necrosis factor receptor-1 (TNFR1), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1), Growth Differentiation Factor-15 (GDF15), Interleukin-6 (IL6) and C reactive protein (CRP)) using mixed-effects models. A subgroup analysis was performed in those exposed to the MI. The response to the MI was defined as the change in the composite cognitive score over the 2-year clinical follow-up period. by modeling the response to the intervention and identifying \"good responders\", i.e., those in the 5th quintile of response at the end of the intervention period (2 years after the measurement of inflammatory markers). We included 1,527 participants (mean age 75.3, SD = 4.4; 64% female). Higher levels of GDF15 and TNFR1 were associated with a worse trajectory in the cognitive composite score in adjusted models. \"Good responders\" had an estimated mean change in the composite score of 0.051 (SD 0.062) over two years of intervention, compared to -0.136 (SD = 0.111) for the \"not-good responders\". Higher IL6 levels were associated with a decreased likelihood of being a \"good responder\" (OR = 0.22, p = 0.018, 95% CI 0.06; 0.78), with similar results for CRP (OR = 0.48, p = 0.009, 95% CI 0.28; 0.84). Higher inflammation was associated with a worse cognitive trajectory among nondemented participants and a lower likelihood of being classified as a \"good responder\" in those receiving a MI. Further confirmation of these findings could lead to the use of systemic inflammation as inclusion or stratification criteria in prevention trials."

These patients exhibit an impaired immune response accompanied by increased oxidative stress. Nutritional support, including parenteral nutrition (PN), is critical in these patients. Intravenous lipid emulsions (ILEs), a key component of PN, provide energy and intervene in the modulation of inflammation. This was a secondary study of a randomized clinical trial at the Reina Sofia University Hospital (Murcia, Spain) for critically ill patients following major abdominal surgery that were administered PN supplemented with olive-oil-based ILE (OO-ILE, <i>n</i> = 29) or a mixed-lipid ILE (soybean oil, medium chain triglycerides, OO and fish oil, SMOF-ILE, <i>n</i> = 25). The effects on clinical outcomes, metabolic markers, oxidative stress, and inflammation were evaluated. No significant differences were observed between groups in the clinical parameters and outcomes, oxidative stress, or inflammatory markers. The within-group evaluation demonstrated an increase in total antioxidant capacity in both groups, while OO-ILE increased the levels of 15-F2t-isoprostane. In addition, the results showed that both mixtures reduced the release of IL-1β and IL-6. These findings suggest that both treatments had similar effects on oxidative stress and inflammatory response in this type of patient."

A total of 69 patients were randomized into three groups: one received standard lipid emulsion, and two received O3FA (Omegaven<sup>®</sup>) at doses of 0.1 g/kg/day and 0.2 g/kg/day, respectively, in addition to Smoflipid<sup>®</sup>. The primary outcomes measured were serum levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) on days 1, 5, and 10 of PN initiation. Secondary outcomes included additional inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1Ra, CXCL10), hepatic function, triglyceride levels, and clinical outcomes such as mortality and length of ICU and hospital stay. Results indicated a significant reduction in CRP, IL-6, and CXCL10 levels in the group receiving 0.1 g/kg/day O3FA compared to the control. Additionally, the higher O3FA dose was associated with a shorter ICU and hospital stay. These findings suggest that O3FA supplementation in PN may reduce inflammation and improve clinical outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients."

However, in SARS-CoV-2 infection, there is an imbalanced immune response, with raised cytokine levels but only a limited interferon response with inefficient viral clearance. Furthermore, the inflammatory response can be exaggerated, which risks both acute and chronic sequelae. Several observational studies have suggested a reduced risk of progression to severe COVID-19 in subjects with a higher omega-3 index. However, randomized studies of omega-3 supplementation have failed to replicate this benefit. Omega-3 fats provide important anti-inflammatory effects; however, fatty fish contains many other fatty acids that provide health benefits distinct from omega-3. Therefore, the immune health benefit of whole salmon oil (SO) was assessed in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19. Eleven subjects were randomized to best supportive care (BSC) with or without a full spectrum, enzymatically liberated SO, dosed at 4g daily, for twenty-eight days. Nasal swabs were taken to measure the change in gene expression of markers of immune response and showed that the SO provided both broad inflammation-resolving effects and improved interferon response. The results also suggest improved lung barrier function and enhanced immune memory, although the clinical relevance needs to be assessed in longer-duration studies. In conclusion, the salmon oil was well tolerated and provided broad inflammation-resolving effects, indicating a potential to enhance immune health."

Increased circulating levels of cytokines have been previously reported and generally associated with worse clinical outcomes. In this context, the modulation of inflammation-related parameters seems to be a reasonable therapeutic option for improving the clinical course of the disease. Based on this, we aimed to compare changes in circulating cytokines when Mediterranean diet alone or in combination with hypercaloric, hyperproteic oral nutritional supplements (ONS), enriched with omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids were administered to patients with HF. Briefly, patients were randomly assigned to receive Mediterranean Diet (control group) vs. Mediterranean Diet plus ONS (intervention group). We observed increased circulating levels of IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1 and IP-10. MCP-1 and IL-6 were associated with overweight and obesity (<i>p</i> = 0.01-0.01-0.04, respectively); IL-6 and IL-8 were positively correlated with fat mass and CRP serum levels (<i>p</i> = 0.02-0.04, respectively). Circulating levels of IL-8 significantly decreased in all patients treated with the Mediterranean diet, while IL-6 and IP-10 only significantly decreased in patients that received plus ONS. In the univariate analysis, MCP-1 and its combination with IL-6 were associated with increased mortality (<i>p</i> = 0.02), while the multivariate analysis confirmed that MCP-1 was an independent factor for mortality (OR 1.01, 95%ci 1.01-1.02). In conclusion, nutritional support using hypercaloric, hyperproteic, n-3 enriched ONS in combination with Mediterranean Diet was associated with decreased circulating levels of some cytokines and could represent an interesting step for improving heart functionality of patients with HF."

This study is a parallel, randomized, double-blind, controlled, 12-week supplementation trial, investigating the anti-inflammatory effects of dietary intake of fish oil and evening primrose oil (EPO), in patients with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. The primary outcomes were changes in the nutritional status and inflammatory cytokines of patients during the study. The secondary outcomes were changes in hematological and biochemical parameters and fatty acid profile. Of the 32 eligible patients, half of them is randomly assigned to a treatment arm with fish oil and EPO (n = 16), or a control arm (n = 16) with mineral oil as a placebo. The intervention group was taking 2 gel capsules of fish oil and 3 gel capsules of EPO (400 mg eicosapentaenoic acid, 600 mg docosahexaenoic acid, and 351 mg gamma-linolenic acid) fish oil and evening primrose oil for 12 weeks, during their chemotherapy. The control/placebo group was taking 5 gel capsules of 1g of mineral oil. One of the patients dropped out due to discontinuation of the treatment (in the placebo group) and two did not show up at the post-treatment measurements (in the intervention group), thus, 29 women completed the study. The results showed an increase in plasma levels of docosapentaenoic acid (22:5n-3), docosahexaenoic acid (22:6n-3), total n-3PUFA, vaccenic acid (18:1n-7), and a decrease in n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio in the intervention group. An increase in the plasma level of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (20:3n-6) was observed in the placebo group. There was no difference in plasma levels of interleukin (IL) IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha, while the level of IL-6 decreased in both groups and was significantly lower in the intervention group at the end of the study. In conclusion, this supplementation improved the PUFA status and decreased the level of IL-6 in breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Consequently, this treatment may help reduce cancer complications resulting from impaired lipid metabolism and inflammation. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03516253.

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplements have demonstrated an effect on cardiovascular endpoints in some clinical trials. Platelet-modifying and anti-inflammatory properties are among the proposed beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA. We investigated the effect of a high-dose n-3 PUFA supplement on platelet function and inflammatory markers in FH subjects. We performed a randomized, double-blind trial with a crossover design. Inclusion criteria were genetically verified heterozygous FH, stable disease, statin treatment >12 months, and age 18-75 years. Trial participants were allocated to two treatment periods in random order. The treatment periods (three months each) were separated by a three-month washout period. N-3 PUFA (1840 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 1520 mg docosahexaenoic acid) and placebo (olive oil) were administered in four capsules daily. Endpoints were platelet function and inflammatory markers, assessed by platelet function analyzer, soluble markers P-selectin, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM), 27 cytokines, and hematological parameters. Thirty-four heterozygous FH individuals completed the trial. No treatment effect (<i>p</i> = 0.93) from n-3 PUFA on the platelet function analyzer was found (2 s, 95% CI [-13, 6]). In our FH population, n-3 PUFA did not influence the levels of P-selectin (-2.0, 95% CI [-5.0, 2.0], <i>p</i> = 0.41), VCAM (0, 95% CI [-14.2, 14.2], <i>p</i> > 0.99), ICAM (-27.0, 95% CI [-70.1, 16.5]; <i>p</i> = 0.21), cytokine levels, or hematological parameters.

One eye per patient was evaluated. Thirty-four patients were recruited (75% men, mean age 31 years), with 15 randomized to the control group and 19 to the DHA-treated group. Corneal topography variables and plasma biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammatory status were evaluated. A panel of fatty acids in blood samples was also assessed. There were significant between-group differences in the astigmatism axis, asphericity coefficient, and intraocular pressure in favor of the DHA group. Additionally, between-group significant differences in total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), free glutathione (GSH) and GSH/GSSG ratio, as well as reduced values of inflammatory markers, including interleukin (IL)-4, IL-6, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF-A) were found. These preliminary findings support the usefulness of the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects of DHA supplementation for targeting underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of keratoconus. Prolonged duration of DHA supplementation may be needed to detect more noticeable clinical changes in corneal topography."

Exercise and nutrition, particularly omega-3 fatty acids, are able to affect inflammation. Therefore, we examined the effects of an 8-week exercise and dietary intervention on the inflammatory response in community-dwelling old adults. All participants received weekly vibration and home-based resistance exercise. Furthermore, participants were randomized to either a control, high-protein (1.2-1.5 g/kg), or high-protein, omega-3-enriched (2.2 g/day) diet. Before and after treatment, inflammatory markers in fasting serum and after whole-blood ex vivo lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation were assessed. Gene expression levels of inflammatory markers were quantified in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Sixty-one participants (age: 70.6 ± 4.7 years; 47% men) completed the study. According to generalized linear mixed models, a high-protein, omega-3-enriched diet decreased circulating anti-inflammatory interleukin (IL-) 10 and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA). Sex-stratified analyses showed also significantly reduced pro-inflammatory markers in men with a high-protein, omega-3-enriched diet. Gene expression of IL-1RA was significantly reduced after both protein-enriched diets compared with controls. In comparison to a high-protein diet, exercise alone showed lower LPS-induced release of c-c motif chemokine ligand-2 (CCL-2), which tended to be more pronounced in men compared with women. Eight weeks of a high-protein, omega-3-enriched diet combined with exercise decreased circulating anti-inflammatory markers, and pro-inflammatory markers in men. A high-protein diet attenuated anti-inflammatory markers on gene expression level in PBMC. Exercise alone resulted in a lower pro-inflammatory response to LPS-exposure in whole-blood cultures."

We recently reported that vitamin D supplementation with or without omega 3 fatty acids reduced autoimmune disease by 22% in the VITAL study. Objective: To investigate the effects of vitamin D3 and/or n-3 FAs on changes in systemic inflammatory biomarkers including pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines over a 4-year period in the VITAL sub-cohort with in-person evaluations at the Center for Clinical Investigations (CCI) in Boston. Design: Serum levels of four inflammatory biomarkers (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein [hs-CRP], interleukin-6, interleukin-10, and tumor necrosis factor-α) were measured in a total of 2713 samples from those 1054 VITAL/CCI participants (aged 64.9 ± 6.5 years, 49% female, 84% white, and 9% black) at baseline, year 2, and year 4 follow-up visits. Results: In multiple-adjusted models, vitamin D3 supplementation decreased serum hs-CRP levels by 19% at 2-year follow-up (nominal p = 0.007; p-value after multiple comparison adjustment = 0.028), but not at 4-year follow-up (nominal and adjusted p-values > 0.05). The effects of vitamin D3 on other inflammatory markers were not statistically significant either at year 2 or year 4 (all adjusted p-values > 0.05). Marine n-3 FAs were not significantly associated with changes of all the above inflammatory markers either at years 2 and 4, after multiple comparison adjustment (all p-values > 0.05). Conclusions: Vitamin D3 supplementation with or without n-3 FAs decreased hs-CRP by 19% at year 2, but not other inflammatory biomarkers at year 2 or year 4, while n-3 FAs with or without vitamin D3 did not significantly affect these biomarkers at either time point. Our findings support a potential role of vitamin D supplementation in modulating the chronic inflammatory process, systemic inflammation, and possibly autoimmune disease progression."

DHA+EPA supplementation increased (p < 0.01) plasma DHA and EPA concentrations throughout the treatment period. NfL concentrations increased from baseline to week 26 in both groups (treatment (<0.001); placebo (p < 0.05)), with starting players (vs. non-starters) showing significant higher circulating concentrations at week 26 (p < 0.01). Fish oil (DHA+EPA) supplementation did not mitigate the adverse effects of RSHI, as measured by NfL levels; however, participants with the highest plasma DHA+EPA concentrations tended to have lower NfL levels. DHA+EPA supplementation had no effects on inflammatory cytokine levels at any of the timepoints tested. These findings emphasize the need for effective strategies to protect American football participants from the effects of RSHI."

Strategies targeting persistent inflammation are needed to improve health in people living with HIV. The gut microbiota likely interacts with the immune system, but the clinical implications of modulating the dysbiosis by nutritional supplementation are unclear. Methods: Pilot, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial in which 24 HIV-infected on ART were randomized to supplementation with a daily mixture of symbiotics, omega-3/6 fatty acids and amino acids, or placebo four weeks, in combination with ART. We analyzed inflammatory markers and T-cell activation changes and their correlations with shifts in fecal microbiota. Results: Twenty-four HIV-infected children were recruited and randomized to receive a symbiotic nutritional supplement or placebo. Mean age was 12 ± 3.9 years, 62.5% were female. All were on ART and had HIV RNA < 50/mL. We did not detect changes in inflammatory (IL-6, IL-7, IP-10), microbial translocation (sCD14), mucosal integrity markers (IFABP, zonulin) or the kynurenine to tryptophan ratio, or changes in markers of the adaptive immune response in relation to the intervention. However, we found correlations between several key bacteria and the assessed inflammatory and immunological parameters, supporting a role of the microbiota in immune modulation in children with HIV. Conclusions: In this exploratory study, a four-week nutritional supplementation had no significant effects in terms of decreasing inflammation, microbial translocation, or T-cell activation in HIV-infected children. However, the correlations found support the interaction between gut microbiota and the immune system."

      "resumen": "Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) can exert antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties, but the exact molecular mechanism underlying their effects is still not fully understood. We conducted both in vitro and clinical investigations to test which EPA or DHA metabolites are involved in these anti-inflammatory, neuroprotective and antidepressant effects. In vitro, we used the human hippocampal progenitor cell line HPC0A07/03C, and pre-treated cells with either EPA or DHA, followed by interleukin 1beta (IL1β), IL6 and interferon-alpha (IFN-α). Both EPA and DHA prevented the reduction in neurogenesis and the increase in apoptosis induced by these cytokines; moreover, these effects were mediated by the lipoxygenase (LOX) and cytochrome P450 (CYP450) EPA/DHA metabolites, 5-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid (HEPE), 4-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (HDHA), 18-HEPE, 20-HDHA, 17(18)-epoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (EpETE) and 19(20)-epoxydocosapentaenoic acid (EpDPA), detected here for the first time in human hippocampal neurones using mass spectrometry lipidomics of the supernatant. In fact, like EPA/DHA, co-treatment with these metabolites prevented cytokines-induced reduction in neurogenesis and apoptosis. Moreover, co-treatment with 17(18)-EpETE and 19(20)-EpDPA and the soluble epoxide hydroxylase (sEH) inhibitor, TPPU (which prevents their conversion into dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (DiHETE)/ dihydroxydocosapentaenoic acid (DiHDPA) metabolites) further enhanced their neurogenic and anti-apoptotic effects. Interestingly, these findings were replicated in a sample of n = 22 patients with a DSM-IV Major Depressive Disorder, randomly assigned to treatment with either EPA (3.0 g/day) or DHA (1.4 g/day) for 12 weeks, with exactly the same LOX and CYP450 lipid metabolites increased in the plasma of these patients following treatment with their precursor, EPA or DHA, and some evidence that higher levels of these metabolites were correlated with less severe depressive symptoms. Overall, our study provides the first evidence for the relevance of LOX- and CYP450-derived EPA/DHA bioactive lipid metabolites as neuroprotective molecular targets for human hippocampal neurogenesis and depression, and highlights the importance of sEH inhibitors as potential therapeutic strategy for patients suffering from depressive symptoms."

Adjusting for pre-supplementation reactivity, age, sagittal abdominal diameter, and sex, omega-3 supplementation altered telomerase (p = 0.05) and IL-10 (p = 0.05) stress reactivity; both supplementation groups were protected from the placebo group's 24% and 26% post-stress declines in the geometric means of telomerase and IL-10, respectively. Omega-3 also reduced overall cortisol (p = 0.03) and IL-6 (p = 0.03) throughout the stressor; the 2.5 g/d group had 19% and 33% lower overall cortisol levels and IL-6 geometric mean levels, respectively, compared to the placebo group.

The current standard type of intravenous lipid emulsion (IVLE) used as parenteral nutrition is the mixture of medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) and long chain triglyceride (LCT) rich in ω-6. Studies showed that ω-6 is associated with higher level of proinflammatory cytokines, leading to increased mortality rate, morbidity rate, and postoperative recovery time. The latest generation of emulsion is a mixture of MCT, LCT, olive oil (OO), and fish oil (FO) which may optimize the ω6/ω3 ratio. This study aimed to compare the effect of MCT/LCT/OO/FO IVLE to standard IVLE on IL-1β, IL-8 and serum fatty acids in infants who had undergone gastrointestinal surgery. <b>Methods:</b> A single-blind, randomised controlled, pretest-posttest design study was done in twelve subjects that were classified into two groups. Group 1 received standard IVLE, group 2 received MCT/LCT/OO/FO IVLE. The type of standard and MCT/LCT/OO/FO IVLE used in this study were Lipofundin 20% and SMOFlipid 20%, respectively, both administered for three consecutive days in 1-4 gram/kilogram/day. IL-1β and IL-8 were examined using ELISA while fatty acids was analyzed using gas chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Mac 23. <b>Results:</b> No statistical difference was found in age, gender, birth weight and diagnosis between both groups. Leukocyte was significantly lower in MCT/LCT/OO/FO group 3 days after surgery (p=0.025). CRP was lower in MCT/LCT/OO/FO group 3 days after surgery (p=0.01) and in changes within 3 days (p=0.016). There were no differences in IL-1β, IL-8 and ω-3 but ω-6 was higher in standard IVFE group on third day after surgery (p=0,048) <b>Conclusion:</b> MCT/LCT/OO/FO IVLE can significantly lower leukocyte, CRP and ω-6 levels and is comparable with standard IVLE on IL-1β, IL-8 and ω-3 levels in infants who had undergone gastrointestinal surgery."

      "resumen": "Periodontitis is a chronic multifactorial inflammatory disease that leads to the loss of supportive tissues around the teeth with gradual deterioration of masticatory function and esthetics, resulting eventually in the decrease of the life quality. Host immune response triggered by bacterial biofilm is responsible for the chronic periodontal inflammation and ongoing tissue loss. Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) have anti-inflammatory properties, thus may be used for the treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the effect of dietary supplementation with omega-3 PUFA in the patients with stage III and IV periodontitis. Thirty otherwise healthy patients were treated with scaling and root planning (SRP). In the test group (<i>n</i> = 16), patients were additionally supplemented with 2.6 g of EPA and 1.8 g of DHA. In the control group (<i>n</i> = 14), patients received only SRP. Periodontal examination was performed at baseline and three months following initial therapy. Salivary samples were taken twice at baseline and at the end of the experiment. We found that there was a statistically significant reduction in the bleeding on probing (BOP) and improvement of clinical attachment loss (CAL) at three months in the test group compared to the control group. Moreover, a statistically significant higher percentage of closed pockets (probing depth ≤ 4 mm without BOP) was achieved in the test group vs. control group after three months of treatment. Accordingly, the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-17 were markedly lower, while the level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 was significantly higher in the salivary samples of the patients supplemented with omega-3 PUFA at three months in comparison to the patients treated with SRP alone. Our findings demonstrate that dietary intervention with high-dose of omega-3 PUFA during non-surgical therapy may have potential benefits in the management of periodontitis."

      "resumen": "Background Epeleuton is 15-hydroxy eicosapentaenoic acid ethyl ester, a second-generation synthetic n-3 fatty acid derivative of eicosapentaenoic acid. The primary objective was to assess the effect of epeleuton on markers of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with post hoc analyses of cardiometabolic markers. Methods and Results In a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 96 adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and body mass index 25 to 40 were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive epeleuton 2 g/day, epeleuton 1 g/day, or placebo for 16 weeks. A total of 27% of patients had diabetes mellitus. Primary end points of changes in alanine aminotransferase and liver stiffness did not improve at week 16. Secondary and post hoc analyses investigated changes in cardiometabolic markers. Epeleuton 2 g/day significantly decreased triglycerides, very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and total cholesterol without increasing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Despite a low mean baseline hemoglobin A1C (HbA<sub>1C</sub>; 6.3±1.3%), epeleuton 2 g/day significantly decreased HbA<sub>1c</sub> (-0.4%; <i>P</i>=0.026). Among patients with baseline HbA<sub>1c</sub> >6.5%, epeleuton 2 g/day decreased HbA<sub>1c</sub> by 1.1% (<i>P</i>=0.047; n=26). Consistent dose-dependent reductions were observed for fasting plasma glucose, insulin, and insulin resistance indices. Epeleuton 2 g/day decreased circulating markers of cardiovascular risk and endothelial dysfunction. Epeleuton was well tolerated, with a safety profile not different from placebo. Conclusions While epeleuton did not meet its primary end points on alanine aminotransferase or liver stiffness, it significantly decreased triglycerides, HbA<sub>1C</sub>, plasma glucose, and inflammatory markers. These data suggest epeleuton may have potential for cardiovascular risk reduction and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease by simultaneously targeting hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, and systemic inflammation.

Fifteen endurance athletes participated in the study. In a randomized, double-blinded cross-over controlled design, the athletes were supplemented with a re-esterified triglyceride containing 2.1 g/day of DHA + 240 mg/day of EPA or placebo for 10 weeks. After a 4-week wash out period, participants were supplemented with the opposite treatment. Before and after each supplementation period, participants performed one eccentric-induced muscle damage exercise training session (ECC). Before, post-exercise min and 24 and 48 h after exercise, muscle soreness, knee isokinetic strength and muscle damage and inflammatory markers were tested. No significant differences in strength deficit variables were found between the two conditions in any of the testing sessions. However, a significant effect was observed in IL1β (<i>p</i> <i>=</i> 0.011) and IL6 (<i>p</i> <i>=</i> 0.009), which showed significantly lower values after DHA consumption than after placebo ingestion. Moreover, a significant main effect was observed in CPK (<i>p =</i> 0.014) and LDH-5 (<i>p =</i> 0.05), in which significantly lower values were found after DHA + EPA consumption. In addition, there was a significant effect on muscle soreness (<i>p =</i> 0.049), lower values being obtained after DHA + EPA consumption. Ten weeks of re-esterified DHA + EPA promoted lower concentrations of inflammation and muscle damage markers and decreased muscle soreness but did not improve the strength deficit after an ECC in endurance athletes."

Fifty-three men working in gas stations were treated with ω3FA (<i>n</i> = 29) or placebo (<i>n</i> = 24) for 60 days. C-reactive protein, interleukin-12 (IL-12), transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), interferon γ (IFN-γ), tumor necrosis factor α, IL-10, and IL-17 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method before and after the completion of the trial. The concentrations of IFN-γ and IL-17 were significantly decreased in ω3FA group compared with the placebo group (<i>P</i> < 0.001). Moreover, the levels of inhibitory cytokines including TGF-β and IL-10 significantly were increased in ω3FA group (<i>P</i> < 0.001).

This research concerns a prospective, randomized, double-blind study in patients with CKD undergoing hemodialysis. The participants were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: the study group (group A; 46 patients) received 4 capsules (2.4 g) of omega-3 fatty acids daily during the 12-week intervention, while patients in the control group (group B; 47 patients) received 4 capsules of paraffin oil. The patients' general characteristics, nutritional indicators, renal disease markers and inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α)) were evaluated. No differences were found between the general characteristics of the patients (<i>P</i> < 0.05), and no differences were shown in the nutritional indicators and markers of kidney disease (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Patients in group A showed significant decreases in levels of C-reactive protein, IL-6, TNF-α, and the IL-10/IL-6 ratio after 12 weeks of supplementation (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Patients in group B did not show any significant changes in concentrations of inflammatory markers during the intervention (<i>P</i> < 0.05). In conclusion, oral supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids produces a significant decrease in the concentrations of inflammation markers in patients with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis. <b>Novelty</b> Oral supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids produced significant decreases in the concentrations of inflammation markers.

Seventy patients with stable PAD classified as Rutherford stage 2 or 3 and good control of cardiovascular factors were randomised to receive either 4 g n-3 PUFA or placebo daily for 3 months in a double-blind fashion. Primary endpoint was endothelial function assessed by flow-mediated vasodilation (FMD). In addition, ankle-brachial index, maximum and pain-free walking distances were determined. Lipid parameters including the omega-3 index reflecting n-3 PUFA intake as well as pro-inflammatory, endothelial and platelet activation markers were measured over the same time interval. After 3 months of treatment with 4 g n-3 PUFA daily, a significant improvement of FMD was observed compared with placebo (n-3 PUFA, median Δ 3·7 (interquartile range (IQR) -1·8, 7·1) % v. placebo, Δ -0·5 (IQR -6·5, 3·0) %, P = 0·01 between the groups).

In response to n-3 PUFA, an improvement of lipid parameters with a pronounced increase in the omega-3 index was seen. No changes were found for other parameters.

Objectives of this study were to evaluate the effect of EIN on immune function, inflammation response and nutrition status when compared to standard enteral nutrition (SEN). <i>Methods</i>: Totally 124 gastric cancer patients after gastrectomy were randomized to receive early 5-days postoperative EIN (formula enriched with arginine, glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids and nucleotide), or SEN. The primary end-points were CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells as well as counts of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>, IgG, IgM, and IgA levels. Second-points included white blood cell (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels and nutritional index such as serum albumin, prealbumin, and transferrin concentration. <i>Results:</i> There existed significant difference in primary end-points between EIN group and SEN group. The proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells, CD3<sup>+</sup> T-cells and the counts of CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup>, IgG, IgM, and IgA were higher in EIN group eventually. Meanwhile, the level of WBC, CRP and TNF-α were significantly lower in EIN group finally. But there were no other significant differences in nutritional markers between two groups. <i>Conclusion:</i> Early postoperative EIN significantly improves immune function and inflammatory response in gastric cancer patients undergoing gastrectomy."

We hypothesized that completing a 12-week omega-3 supplementation period along with whole body resistance exercise (3 times/wk) would result in a significantly greater improvement in lean tissue mass as well as a significant decrease in interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor-α when compared to placebo. A total of 23 older men (≥65 years old) were randomized to an omega-3 supplementation group (n = 11) or placebo group (n = 12), and all the participants completed the same whole body progressive resistance training program. Baseline and 12-week data collection included body composition, muscle strength, functional ability, and inflammatory cytokines. Results indicated a significant main effect for time (all P < .05) for percent body fat (-2.5%), lean tissue mass (+1.1%), lumbar bone mineral density (+1.1%), hip bone mineral content (+1.1%), chest press strength (+31%), leg press strength (+37%), timed-up-and-go (-6.6%), and 6-minute walk distance (+4.5%) from baseline to post 12 weeks. No significant effects were noted for the 2 inflammatory cytokines measured (P > .05). We conclude that progressive resistance training exercise is an excellent method to enhance parameters of body composition, skeletal muscle strength, and functional ability in older men, whereas omega-3 supplementation did nothing to enhance these parameters or influence inflammatory biomarkers."

The present study involved a 12-week double-blind, randomized controlled trial to explore the effects of fish oil with different doses (0.31, 0.62 and 1.24 g d-1 of EPA and DHA) on serum fatty acids and cardio-metabolic biomarkers including adiponectin, inflammatory markers, lipid profiles and fasting glucose in healthy middle-aged and elderly Chinese people. 240 volunteers met our inclusion criteria. A total of 39 subjects dropped out and 201 finally completed the intervention. No significant differences in baseline characteristics and daily intakes of dietary nutrients were detected among all groups. After a 12-week intervention, fish oil dose-dependently enhanced serum EPA, DHA, n-3PUFA and adiponectin (except for 0.31 g d-1), but decreased serum n-6/n-3PUFA, TG and fasting glucose. Changes in the above indicators from the baseline to week 12 in fish oil groups significantly differed from those in the control. Meanwhile, all the doses of EPA and DHA led to decreases in serum CRP; only 1.24 g d-1 led to an increase in HDL-C with a concurrent decrease in TC/HDL-C even though these changes were not significantly different among all groups. All the findings suggested that fish oil dose-dependently regulated serum PUFA and cardio-metabolic biomarkers including adiponectin, CRP, lipid profiles and fasting glucose in healthy middle-aged and elderly Chinese people who consumed insufficient dietary n-3PUFA, and the most desirable changes were observed for 1.24 g d-1."

Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation has been shown to improve endothelial function in a number of diseases; thus, it could be of high clinical relevance in APS. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of n-3 PUFA supplementation on endothelial function (primary outcome) of patients with primary APS (PAPS). A 16-week randomized clinical trial was conducted with 22 adult women with PAPS. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive placebo (PL, <i>n</i> = 11) or n-3 PUFA (ω-3, <i>n</i> = 11) supplementation. Before (pre) and after (post) 16 weeks of the intervention, patients were assessed for endothelial function (peripheral artery tonometry) (primary outcome). Patients were also assessed for systemic markers of endothelial cell activation, inflammatory markers, dietary intake, international normalized ratio (INR), and adverse effects. At post, ω-3 group presented significant increases in endothelial function estimates reactive hyperemia index (RHI) and logarithmic transformation of RHI (LnRHI) when compared with PL (+13 vs. -12%, <i>p</i> = 0.06, ES = 0.9; and +23 vs. -22%, <i>p</i> = 0.02, ES = 1.0). No changes were observed for e-selectin, vascular adhesion molecule-1, and fibrinogen levels (<i>p</i> > 0.05). In addition, ω-3 group showed decreased circulating levels of interleukin-10 (-4 vs. +45%, <i>p</i> = 0.04, ES = -0.9) and tumor necrosis factor (-13 vs. +0.3%, <i>p</i> = 0.04, ES = -0.95) and a tendency toward a lower intercellular adhesion molecule-1 response (+3 vs. +48%, <i>p</i> = 0.1, ES = -0.7) at post when compared with PL. No changes in dietary intake, INR, or self-reported adverse effects were observed. In conclusion, 16 weeks of n-3 PUFA supplementation improved endothelial function in patients with well-controlled PAPS. These results support a role of n-3 PUFA supplementation as an adjuvant therapy in APS. Registered at http://ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT01956188."

B cells are a poorly studied target of EPA/DHA in humans. Therefore, in this pilot study, we tested how n-3 LC-PUFAs influence B-cell responses of obese humans. Obese men and women were assigned to consume four 1-g capsules per day of olive oil (OO, n=12), fish oil (FO, n=12) concentrate or high-DHA-FO concentrate (n=10) for 12 weeks in a parallel design. Relative to baseline, FO (n=9) lowered the percentage of circulating memory and plasma B cells, whereas the other supplements had no effect. There were no postintervention differences between the three supplements. Next, ex vivo B-cell cytokines were assayed after stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and/or the B-cell receptor (BCR) to determine if the effects of n-3 LC-PUFAs were pathway-dependent. B-cell IL-10 and TNFα secretion was respectively increased with high DHA-FO (n=10), relative to baseline, with respective TLR9 and TLR9+BCR stimulation. OO (n=12) and FO (n=12) had no influence on B-cell cytokines compared to baseline, and there were no differences in postintervention cytokine levels between treatment groups. Finally, ex vivo antibody levels were assayed with FO (n=7) after TLR9+BCR stimulation. Compared to baseline, FO lowered IgM but not IgG levels accompanied by select modifications to the plasma lipidome. Altogether, the results suggest that n-3 LC-PUFAs could modulate B-cell activity in humans, which will require further testing in a larger cohort."

Evidences show tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α play a role in neuroimmunity pathogenesis of migraine. TNF-α increase prostanoid production, hyperexcitability of neurons, and nociceptor activation resulted in neuroinflammation and neurogenic pain. ω-3 fatty acids and curcumin exert neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects via several mechanisms including suppression of TNF-α gene expression and its serum levels. The aim of this study is an evaluation of synergistic effects of ω-3 fatty acids and nano-curcumin on TNF-α gene expression and serum levels in migraine patients. The present study performed as a clinical trial over a 2 month period included 74 episodic migraine patients in 4 groups and received ω-3 fatty acids, nano-curcumin, and combination of them or placebo. At the start and the end of the study, the gene expression of TNF-α and TNF-α serum levels was measured by real-time PCR and ELISA method, respectively. Our results showed that the combination of ω-3 fatty acids and nano-curcumin downregulated TNF-α messenger RNA (mRNA) significantly in a synergistic manner (P < 0.05). As relative to gene expression, a significant greater reduction in serum levels of TNF-α were observed in the combination group, but no significant differences in other groups. Supplementation with ω-3 fatty acids or nano-curcumin alone did not show significant reduction either in mRNA or serum levels of TNF-α. In addition, a much greater reduction in attack frequency was found in the combination group (P < 0.001). These findings indicated that ω-3 fatty acids and curcumin supplementation can be considered as a new promising approach in migraine management."

According to a RCT in UHR-patients supplementation of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) was effective in reducing transition to psychosis risk and to improve symptomatology. Based on preclinical findings, we now investigated state marker properties of and the influence of PUFA on immune markers in a RCT (clinical trials.gov Identifier: NCT00396643). In a longitudinal design we measured plasma levels of the pro-inflammatory interleukin 6 (IL-6), the soluble alpha (Tac) subunit of the interleukin 2 receptor (sIL-2r), and the circulating soluble form of the intercellular adhesion molecule one (sICAM-1), in 79 help-seeking UHR individuals (13-25years of age). Using linear mixed model (LMM) analysis, we investigated the effects of 12weeks supplementation of either 1.2g/d PUFA (n=38) or Placebo (n=41). At baseline, inflammatory markers were not altered in patients who later suffered transition to psychosis within one year (n=12; 11 PUFA-group, 1 PL-group). IL-6 was weakly inverse associated with omega-6 PUFA, and highly increased in nicotine users. In univariate tests of the LMM omega-3 PUFA caused a significant increase of sICAM-1 (p=0.022). PUFA did not significantly influence IL-6 or sIL-2r. The enhancement of sICAM-1 in the PUFA condition is suggestive for supportive effects on vascular immune response and immediate Th1 helper cell mediated immune answer, which was found disturbed in manifest schizophrenia, e.g. by facilitating the leukocyte adhesion and migration across the endothelium."

      "resumen": "Langerhans cells (LCs) are sentinels of skin's immune system, their loss from epidermis contributing to UVR suppression of cell-mediated immunity (CMI). Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids show potential to reduce UVR suppression of CMI in mice and humans, potentially through modulation of LC migration. Our objectives were to examine whether eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) ingestion influences UV-mediated effects on epidermal LC numbers and levels of immunomodulatory mediators including prostaglandin (PG)D<sub>2</sub> , which is expressed by LC. In a double-blind randomised controlled study, healthy individuals took 5-g EPA-rich (n=40) or control (n=33) lipid for 12 weeks; UVR-exposed and unexposed skin samples were taken pre- and postsupplementation. Epidermal LC numbers were assessed by immunofluorescence for CD1a, and skin blister fluid PG and cytokines were quantified by LC-MS/MS and Luminex assay, respectively. Presupplementation, UVR reduced mean (SEM) LC number/mm<sup>2</sup> from 913 (28) to 322 (40) (P<.001), and mean PGD<sub>2</sub> level by 37% from 8.1 (11.6) to 5.1 (5.6) pg/μL; P<.001), while IL-8 level increased (P<.001). Despite confirmation of EPA bioavailability in red blood cells and skin in the active group, no between-group effect of EPA was found on UVR modulation of LC numbers, PGD<sub>2</sub> or cytokine levels postsupplementation. Thus, no evidence was found for EPA reduction of photoimmunosuppression through an impact on epidermal LC numbers. Intriguingly, UVR exposure substantially reduced cutaneous PGD<sub>2</sub> levels in humans, starkly contrasting with reported effects of UVR on other skin PG. Lowered PGD<sub>2</sub> levels could reflect LC loss from the epidermis and/or altered dendritic cell activity and may be relevant for phototherapy of skin disease."

Regarding the combinative effects of Nutrigenomics and Nutrigenetics and due to the lack of in vivo studies conducted using natural ligands of PPARs, we aimed to evaluate the effects of DHA supplementation on vascular function, telomerase activity, and PPARγ-LXRα-ABCA1 pathway, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), based on the Pro12Ala polymorphism in PPARγ encoding gene. 72 T2DM patients (36 dominant and 36 recessive allele carriers), aged 30-70, with body mass index of 18.5 to 35 kg/m2, will be participated in this double blind randomized controlled trial. In each group, stratification will be performed based on sex and age and participants will be randomly assigned to receive 2.4 g/day DHA or placebo (paraffin) for 8 weeks. PPARγ genotyping will be carried out using PCR-RFLP method; Telomerase activity will be estimated by PCR-ELISA TRAP assay; mRNA expression levels of target genes will be assessed using real time PCR. Serum levels of ADMA, sCD163 and adiponectin, will be measured using ELISA commercial kits. The present study is designed in order to help T2DM patients to modify their health conditions based on their genetic backgrounds, and to recommend the proper food ingredients as the natural agonists for PPARs in order to prevent and treat metabolic abnormalities of the disease."

In non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, the activation of liver resident macrophage pool is a central event in the progression of liver injury. The aims of the present study were to evaluate the polarization of liver macrophages and the possible role of Wnt3a production by macrophages in hepatic progenitor cell response in the progression of pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. 32 children with biopsy-proven non-alcoholic fatty liver disease were included. 20 out of 32 patients were treated with docosahexaenoic acid for 18 months and biopsies at the baseline and after 18 months were included. Hepatic progenitor cell activation, macrophage subsets and Wnt/β-catenin pathway were evaluated by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. Our results indicated that in pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, pro-inflammatory macrophages were the predominant subset. Macrophage polarization was correlated with Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Activity Score, ductular reaction, and portal fibrosis; docosahexaenoic acid treatment determined a macrophage polarization towards an anti-inflammatory phenotype in correlation with the reduction of serum inflammatory cytokines, with increased macrophage apoptosis, and with the up-regulation of macrophage Wnt3a expression; macrophage Wnt3a expression was correlated with β-catenin phosphorylation in hepatic progenitor cells and signs of commitment towards hepatocyte fate. In conclusion, macrophage polarization seems to have a key role in the progression of pediatric non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; the modulation of macrophage polarization could drive hepatic progenitor cell response by Wnt3a production."

The purpose of this study is to compare plasma cytokine levels in children after HSCT using an n-3 FA-containing lipid emulsion (LE) and a soybean oil-based formulation in PN. A randomized double-blind controlled trial was conducted on 14 children following HSCT. Children were randomized to receive either a fish oil or a soybean oil LE. Blood samples were drawn at baseline, on Day 10 and after completion of PN to analyze plasma interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), 2 (IL-2), 6 (IL-6), 8 (IL-8), 10 (IL-10), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). After 10 days of PN, there were no significant changes in interleukins levels when comparing the two groups or time points (baseline vs. Day 10 of PN). In children requiring PN >21 days, IL-10 and TNF-α levels (P ≤ 0.05) were lower in the fish-oil-containing LE group. Fish oil- and soybean oil-supplemented PN administered for at least 10 days does not cause inflammatory changes. Prolonged PN based on fish oil LE may modulate the inflammatory response."

The purpose of this study was to determine if a mixed flavonoid-fish oil supplement (Q-Mix; 1000 mg quercetin, 400 mg isoquercetin, 120 mg epigallocatechin (EGCG) from green tea extract, 400 mg n3-PUFAs (omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid) (220 mg eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and 180 mg docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) from fish oil, 1000 mg vitamin C, 40 mg niacinamide, and 800 µg folic acid) would reduce complications associated with obesity; that is, reduce inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and alter genomic profiles in overweight women. Overweight and obese women (n = 48; age = 40-70 years) were assigned to Q-Mix or placebo groups using randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled procedures. Overnight fasted blood samples were collected at 0 and 10 weeks and analyzed for cytokines, C-reactive protein (CRP), F₂-isoprostanes, and whole-blood-derived mRNA, which was assessed using Affymetrix HuGene-1_1 ST arrays. Statistical analysis included two-way ANOVA models for blood analytes and gene expression and pathway and network enrichment methods for gene expression. Plasma levels increased with Q-Mix supplementation by 388% for quercetin, 95% for EPA, 18% for DHA, and 20% for docosapentaenoic acid (DPA). Q-Mix did not alter plasma levels for CRP (p = 0.268), F2-isoprostanes (p = 0.273), and cytokines (p > 0.05). Gene set enrichment analysis revealed upregulation of pathways in Q-Mix vs. placebo related to interferon-induced antiviral mechanism (false discovery rate, FDR < 0.001). Overrepresentation analysis further disclosed an inhibition of phagocytosis-related inflammatory pathways in Q-Mix vs. placebo. Thus, a 10-week Q-Mix supplementation elicited a significant rise in plasma quercetin, EPA, DHA, and DPA, as well as stimulated an antiviral and inflammation whole-blood transcriptomic response in overweight women."

The aim was to investigate the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) diet supplementation on cytokine production, by lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated PBMCs after exercise, and the in vitro influence of temperature. Fifteen male soccer players were randomly assigned to a placebo or an experimental group. The experimental group consumed an almond-based beverage enriched with DHA (1.16 g DHA/day) for 8 weeks, whereas the placebo group consumed a similar non-enriched beverage. Blood samples were taken before and after the nutritional intervention in basal conditions and 2 h after acute exercise. Nutritional intervention significantly increased the DHA content in erythrocytes only in experimental group (from 34 ± 3.6 to 43 ± 3.6 nmols DHA/10(9) erythrocytes). Exercise significantly increased Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) in PBMCs but only in the placebo group (203 %). Exercise also significantly increased IL6, IL8, VEGF, INFγ, TNFα, IL1α, IL1β, MCP1, and EGG production rates by LPS-stimulated PBMCs, and this response was attenuated by DHA supplementation. Temperature but not DHA also affected the pattern of cytokine production increasing IL6, IL8, IL1β, and MCP1 synthesis. The higher change was evidenced in IL1β increasing the production rate at 39.5 °C from 3.19 ± 0.77 to 22.4 ± 6.1 pg/h 10(6) PBMC in placebo and from 2.36 ± 0.11 to 10.6 ± 0.38 pg/h 10(6) PBMC in the supplemented group. The profile of affected cytokines differs between temperature and exercise, suggesting a different PBMC activation pathway. DHA diet supplementation only attenuated cytokine production after exercise and not that induced by temperature."

Here we aimed to evaluate the effects of 24 wk of resistance training combined with a healthy dietary approach (n-6/n-3 ratio < 2) in a population of healthy and physically active older women (65-70 years). The three-armed randomized controlled trial included a resistance training + healthy diet group (RT-HD), a resistance training group (RT), and controls (CON). All subjects included in the study were physically active and had low levels of serum inflammatory markers. In accordance with the dietary goals, the n-6/n-3 ratio dietary intake significantly decreased only in RT-HD by 42%. An increase in 1 repetition maximum in leg extension occurred in RT (+20.4%) and RT-HD (+20.8%), but not in CON. Interestingly, leg lean mass significantly increased only in RT-HD (+1.8%). While there were no changes in serum C-reactive protein and IL-6 levels, a significant decrease in serum level of the pro-inflammatory precursor arachidonic acid (-5.3 ± 9.4%) together with an increase in serum n-3 docosahexaenoic acid (+8.3%) occurred only in RT-HD. Altogether, this study demonstrates that the effects of resistance training on muscle mass in healthy older adults can be optimized by the adoption of a healthy diet."

After providing a blood sample at 8:00 am, subjects ingested 0.5 liters flavored water alone or 0.5 liters water with 7 kcal kg-1 chia seed oil (random order), provided another blood sample at 8:30 am, and then started running to exhaustion (~70% VO2max). Additional blood samples were collected immediately post- and 1-h post-exercise. Despite elevations in plasma alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) during the chia seed oil (337%) versus water trial (35%) (70.8 ± 8.6, 20.3 ± 1.8 μg mL(-1), respectively, p < 0.001), run time to exhaustion did not differ between trials (1.86 ± 0.10, 1.91 ± 0.13 h, p = 0.577, respectively). No trial differences were found for respiratory exchange ratio (RER) (0.92 ± 0.01), oxygen consumption, ventilation, ratings of perceived exertion (RPE), and plasma glucose and blood lactate. Significant post-run increases were measured for total leukocyte counts, plasma cortisol, and plasma cytokines (Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Interleukin-8 (IL-8), Interleukin-10 (IL-10), and Tumor necrosis factors-α (TNF-α)), with no trial differences. Chia seed oil supplementation compared to water alone in overnight fasted runners before and during prolonged, intensive running caused an elevation in plasma ALA, but did not enhance run time to exhaustion, alter RER, or counter elevations in cortisol and inflammatory outcome measures."

      "resumen": "The aim of this study was to determine whether supplementation with fish oil-derived n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA) during pregnancy modifies placental PUFA composition, the accumulation of specialised pro-resolving lipid mediators (SPMs, specifically resolvins (Rv), protectins (PD) and upstream precursors) and inflammatory gene expression. Placentas were collected from women (n=51) enrolled in a randomised, placebo controlled trial of n-3 PUFA supplementation from 20-week gestation. Lipids were extracted for fatty acid analysis and SPMs were quantitated by mass spectrometry. Gene expression was determined by qRT-PCR. Using multiple regression analysis, data were correlated for placental n-3 PUFA and SPM levels with PUFA levels in maternal and cord blood erythrocytes. Supplementation with n-3 PUFAs increased placental docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) levels, but not eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) levels (P<0.05), and increased the levels of the SPM precursors 18-hydroxyeicosapentaenoic acid and 17-hydroxydocosahexaenoic acid (17-HDHA) by two- to threefold (P<0.0005). RvD1, 17R-RvD1, RvD2 and PD1 were detectable in all placentas, but concentrations were not significantly increased by n-3 PUFA supplementation. Placental DHA levels were positively associated with maternal and cord DHA levels (P<0.005), and with placental 17-HDHA concentrations (P<0.0001). Placental mRNA expression of PTGS2, IL1β, IL6 and IL10 was unaffected by n-3 PUFA supplementation, but TNFα expression was increased by 14-fold (P<0.05). We conclude that n-3 PUFA supplementation in pregnancy i) enhances placental accumulation of DHA and SPM precursors, ii) does not alter placental EPA levels, and iii) has no stimulatory effects on inflammatory gene expression. Further studies are required to ascertain the biological significance of SPMs in the placenta and the potential immunomodulatory effects of elevating placental SPM levels."

This study examined the effects of high-dose marine n-3 PUFAs added to conventional therapy on the recurrence of AF and on markers of inflammation and oxidative stress. Patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF were randomized to n-3 PUFAs (4 g/day; n = 126) or placebo (n = 64) in a 2:1 ratio in a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study. The primary outcome was time to recurrence of AF. Secondary outcomes were changes in biomarkers of inflammation (serum interleukin [IL]-6, IL-8, IL-10, tissue necrosis factor alpha, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and vascular endothelial growth factor), N-terminal-pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide, and oxidative stress (urinary F2-isoprostanes). AF recurred in 74 patients (58.7%) randomized to n-3 PUFAs and in 30 patients (46.9%) who received placebo; time to recurrence of AF did not differ significantly in the 2 groups (hazard ratio 1.20; 95% confidence interval 0.76 to 1.90, adjusted p = 0.438). Compared with placebo, n-3 PUFAs did not result in clinically meaningful changes in concentrations of inflammatory markers, N-terminal-pro-brain-type natriuretic peptide or F2-isoprostanes. In conclusion, in patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF, treatment with n-3 PUFAs 4 g/day did not reduce the recurrence of AF, nor was it associated with clinically important effects on concentrations of markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.

      "resumen": "Periodontitis is a common chronic inflammatory disease initiated by bacteria, resulting in bone resorption, tooth loss, and systemic inflammation. Long-chain omega-3 fatty acids such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) reduce periodontitis in animals. We aimed to determine whether DHA supplementation with low-dose aspirin would reduce periodontitis in humans. We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled parallel trial lasting 3 mo. Fifty-five adults with moderate periodontitis were randomized to 2,000 mg of DHA or identical soy/corn oil capsules. All participants received 81 mg of aspirin but received no other treatments. We analyzed the primary outcome of per-pocket change in pocket depth using mixed models among teeth with pocket depth ≥5 mm. Secondary outcomes assessed with generalized estimating equations included gingival index, plaque index, and bleeding on probing. Gingival crevicular fluid samples were analyzed for changes in high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and interleukins 6 and 1β (IL-6 and IL-1β). Plasma was analyzed for changes in systemic inflammatory markers, including hsCRP. We confirmed adherence with erythrocyte fatty acid measurement. Forty-six participants completed the trial. While similar at baseline, the proportion of DHA in red blood cell plasma membranes increased from 3.6% ± 0.9% to 6.2% ± 1.6% in the intervention group but did not change among controls. DHA supplementation decreased mean pocket depth (-0.29 ± 0.13; p = .03) and gingival index (-0.26 ± 0.13; p = .04). Plaque index and bleeding on probing did not change. Significant adjusted differences were found between DHA and control for both gingival crevicular fluid hsCRP (-5.3 ng/mL, standard error [SE] = 2.4, p = .03) and IL-1β (-20.1 pg/mL, SE = 8.2, p = .02) but not IL-6 (0.02 pg/mL, SE = 0.71, p = .98) or systemic hsCRP (-1.19 mg/L, SE = 0.90, p = .20). In this randomized controlled trial, aspirin-triggered DHA supplementation significantly improved periodontal outcomes in people with periodontitis, indicating its potential therapeutic efficacy (clinicaltrials.gov NCT01976806)."

Fifteen volunteer male football players were randomly assigned to placebo or experimental and supplemented groups. Blood samples were taken under resting conditions at the beginning and after eight weeks of training under resting and post-exercise conditions. The experimental beverage increased the plasma DHA availability in non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs) and triglyceride fatty acids (TGFAs) and increased the polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) fraction of NEFAs but had no effects on the biomarkers for oxidative balance in plasma. During training, plasma protein markers of oxidative damage, the haemolysis degree and the antioxidant enzyme activities increased, but did not affect lipid oxidative damage. Training season and DHA influenced the circulating levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). Acute exercise did not alter the basal levels of plasma markers for oxidative and nitrosative damage of proteins and lipids, and the antioxidant enzyme activities, although DHA-diet supplementation significantly increased the PGE2 in plasma after acute exercise. In conclusion, the training season and acute exercise, but not the DHA diet supplementation, altered the pattern of plasma oxidative damage, as the antioxidant system proved sufficient to prevent the oxidative damage induced by the acute exercise in well-trained footballers. The DHA-diet supplementation increased the prostaglandin PGE2 plasma evidencing anti-inflammatory effects of DHA to control inflammation after acute exercise."

The aim was to investigate the effect of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) diet supplementation on the plasma cytokine levels and on the peripheral mononuclear (PBMCs) cells cytokine production after a training season or an acute bout of exercise. Fifteen male soccer players were randomly assigned to a placebo or an experimental group. The experimental group consumed an almond-based beverage enriched with DHA, whereas the placebo group consumed the same beverage without DHA. Three blood samples were taken: in basal conditions at the beginning of the nutritional intervention and after eight weeks of training season in basal and post-exercise conditions. The DHA content increased in erythrocytes after 8weeks of training and supplementation. Neither diet supplementation with DHA nor training season altered the basal plasma cytokines and growth factors. Only acute exercise significantly increased plasma IL6 in experimental and placebo groups. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) activation induced the inflammatory response in PBMCs, with a significant production rate of TNFα, IL6 and IL8 mainly after acute exercise. DHA supplementation significantly reduced the rate of TNFα and IL6 production by stimulated PBMCs. Acute exercise increased the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) protein levels in PBMCs, although the increase was only statistically significant in the placebo group. In conclusion, a training season does not induce significant changes in the circulating cytokine profile in well-trained soccer players. Exercise increases the PBMCs cell capabilities to produce cytokines after TLR4 stimulation with LPS and this rate of cytokine production is attenuated by diet DHA supplementation."

      "resumen": "Postmenopausal breast cancer survivors are living longer; however, a common class of drugs, aromatase inhibitors (AI), depletes estrogen levels, promotes bone loss, and heightens fracture risk. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) may offset AI effects to bone because of the known effects on cellular processes of bone turnover. Therefore, we hypothesized that 4 g of EPA and DHA daily for 3 mo would decrease bone turnover in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors on AI therapy in a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled pilot study that included 38 women. At baseline and 3 mo, serum fatty acids, bone turnover, and inflammatory markers were analyzed. Serum EPA and DHA, total and long-chain (LC) omega (n)-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) increased, whereas arachidonic acid, total and LC n-6 PUFA, and the LC n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio decreased compared to placebo (all P < .05). Bone resorption was inhibited in the fish oil responders compared to placebo (P < .05). Inflammatory markers were not altered. This short-term, high-dose fish oil supplementation study's findings demonstrate that fish oil can reduce bone resorption; however, longer-term studies are needed to assess bone density preservation and to explore mechanistic pathways in this population at high risk for bone loss."

In this context, this randomized, prospective, controlled clinical trial was conducted in order to check whether supplementation of 2 g/day of fish oil for 9 weeks alters the production of inflammatory markers, the plasma fatty acid profile and the nutritional status in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). Eleven adults with CRC in chemotherapy were randomized into two groups: (a) supplemented (SG) daily with 2 g/day of encapsulated fish oil [providing 600 mg/day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) + docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)] for 9 weeks (n = 6), and (b) control (CG) (n = 5). All outcomes were evaluated on the day before the first chemotherapy session and 9 weeks later. Plasma TNF-α, IL-1β, IL-10 and IL-17A, the pro/anti-inflammatory balance (ratio TNF-α/IL-10 and IL-1β/IL10) and serum albumin, showed no significant changes between times and study groups (p > 0.05). C-reactive protein (CRP) and the CRP/albumin ratio showed opposite behavior in groups, significantly reducing their values in SG (p < 0.05). Plasma proportions of EPA and DHA increased 1.8 and 1.4 times, respectively, while the ARA reduced approximately 0.6 times with the supplementation (9 weeks vs baseline, p < 0.05). Patients from SG gained 1.2 kg (median) while the CG lost -0.5 kg (median) during the 9 weeks of chemotherapy (p = 0.72). These results demonstrate that 2 g/day of fish oil for 9 weeks of chemotherapy improves CRP values, CRP/albumin status, plasma fatty acid profile and potentially prevents weight loss during treatment."

Omega-3 has been reported to have benefit for endothelial dysfunction, one of the earliest stages of atherosclerosis, and to reduce disease activity in SLE. We performed a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial to examine the effect of Omega-3 on endothelial function, disease activity, inflammatory markers and lipids in SLE. SLE patients (n = 85, mean age 47, 55% Caucasian, 38% African-American, 94% female) were randomly assigned to 3 g of Omega-3 (Lovaza, GSK) versus placebo for 12 weeks. Endothelial function was measured at baseline and at 12 weeks using flow-mediated dilation, calculated using high-resolution B-mode ultrasound of the brachial artery diameter in response to vasoactive stimuli (hyperemia). Disease activity was measured using the physician global assessment and SELENA-SLEDAI score. Inflammatory markers (sICAM-1, sVCAM-1, IL-6) and fasting lipid profile were done at baseline and 12-week follow-up. There was no difference between the treatment groups with respect to changes in flow-mediated dilation parameters or disease activity. An average increase in LDL cholesterol of 3.11 mg/dL (±21.99) was found with Omega-3 versus a decrease of 1.87 mg/dL (±18.29) with placebo (p = 0.0266). In this trial, Omega-3 did not improve endothelial function, disease activity, nor reduce inflammatory markers in SLE. Longer trials might be required if there are delayed clinical effects. There was evidence that Omega-3 may increase LDL cholesterol, but not the LDL/HDL ratio."

Zinc and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids each exhibit anti-inflammatory effects and may be of therapeutic benefit in the disease. The present randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial was designed to investigate the effects of zinc (40 mg/day) and α-linolenic acid (ALA; 2 g/day flaxseed oil) supplementation on markers of inflammation [interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, C-reactive protein (CRP)] and zinc transporter and metallothionein gene expression in 48 postmenopausal women with type 2 DM. No significant effects of zinc or ALA supplementation were observed on inflammatory marker concentrations or fold change in zinc transporter and metallothionein gene expression. Significant increases in plasma zinc concentrations were observed over time in the groups supplemented with zinc alone or combined with ALA (P=.007 and P=.009, respectively). An impact of zinc treatment on zinc transporter gene expression was found; ZnT5 was positively correlated with Zip3 mRNA (P<.001) only in participants receiving zinc, while zinc supplementation abolished the relationship between ZnT5 and Zip10. IL-6 predicted the expression levels and CRP predicted the fold change of the ZnT5, ZnT7, Zip1, Zip7 and Zip10 mRNA cluster (P<.001 and P=.031, respectively). Fold change in the expression of metallothionein mRNA was predicted by TNF-α (P=.022). Associations among inflammatory cytokines and zinc transporter and metallothionein gene expression support an interrelationship between zinc homeostasis and inflammation in type 2 DM."

We therefore compared those postprandial responses between lean and obese men after 3 high-fat challenges differing in fatty acid composition. In a crossover double-blind study, 18 lean (BMI: 18-25 kg/m(2)) and 18 obese (BMI >29 kg/m(2)) middle-aged men received 3 isocaloric high-fat milkshakes containing 95 g fat (88% of energy), either high in SFAs (54% of energy/total fat), MUFAs (83% of energy/total fat), or n3 (omega-3) PUFAs (40% of energy/total fat). Hemodynamics, augmentation index (AIX), leukocyte cell surface adhesion markers, and plasma cytokines involved in vascular adherence, coagulation, and inflammation were measured before and after consumption of the milkshakes. In both groups and after all shakes were consumed, AIX decreased; plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM) 1, sICAM3, soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM) 1, and interleukin-8 increased; monocyte CD11a, CD11b, and CD621 expression increased; neutrophil CD11a, CD11b, and CD621 expression increased; and lymphocyte CD62l expression increased (P < 0.05). Lymphocyte CD11a and CD11b expression decreased in lean participants after consumption of all shakes but did not change in obese participants (P < 0.05). Obese participants had a less pronounced decrease in heart rate after the consumption of all shakes (P < 0.05). MUFA consumption induced a more pronounced decrease in blood pressure and AIX compared with the other milkshakes in both lean and obese participants (P < 0.05). High-fat consumption initiates an activated state of cellular adherence and an atherogenic milieu. This response was independent of fatty acid type consumed or of being lean or obese, despite the clear differences in postprandial TG responses between the groups and different milkshakes. These findings suggest that in addition to increased TGs, other mechanisms are involved in the high-fat consumption-induced activated state of cellular adherence."

Vitamin D and long-chain n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) provide benefit for the prevention of fractures and cardiovascular events, respectively, and both are involved in controlling inflammatory and immune responses. However, published epidemiological data suggest a potential interference of n-3 PUFA supplementation with vitamin D status. Therefore, we aimed to investigate in a randomized controlled clinical trial whether treatment with long chain n-3 PUFA affects vitamin D status in severely obese patients and potential interrelations of vitamin D and PUFA treatment with inflammatory parameters. Fifty-four severely obese (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2) non-diabetic patients were treated for eight weeks with either 3.36 g/d EPA and DHA or the same amount of butter fat as control. Changes in serum 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D] concentrations, plasma fatty acid profiles and circulating inflammatory marker concentrations from baseline to end of treatment were assessed. At baseline 43/54 patients were vitamin D deficient (serum 25(OH)D concentration <50 nmol/l). Treatment with n-3 PUFA did not affect vitamin D status (P = 0.91). Serum 25(OH)D concentration correlated negatively with both IL-6 (P = 0.02) and hsCRP serum concentration (P = 0.03) at baseline. Strikingly, the negative correlations of 25(OH)D with IL-6 and hsCRP were lost after n-3 PUFA treatment. In conclusion, vitamin D status of severely obese patients remained unaffected by n-3 PUFA treatment. However, abrogation of the inverse association of 25(OH)D concentration with inflammatory markers indicated that n-3 PUFA treatment could compensate for some detrimental consequences of vitamin D deficiency."

N-3 PUFA supplementation had no significant effects on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) requirements, clinical symptoms of RA or the concentration of cytokines, eicosanoids and bone turnover markers. However, n-3 PUFA supplementation significantly decreased NSAID requirements and leukotriene B4 levels in patients who weighed more than 55 kg. Our results suggest that n-3 PUFA supplementation has no significant effect on RA but may decrease the requirement for NSAIDs in Korean patients with RA who weigh more than 55 kg."

This study examined adipose and muscle inflammatory markers after treatment of humans with FOs and measured the effects of ω-3 fatty acids on adipocytes and macrophages in vitro. Insulin-resistant, nondiabetic subjects were treated with Omega-3-Acid Ethyl Esters (4 g/day) or placebo for 12 weeks. Plasma macrophage chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) levels were reduced by FO, but the levels of other cytokines were unchanged. The adipose (but not muscle) of FO-treated subjects demonstrated a decrease in macrophages, a decrease in MCP-1, and an increase in capillaries, and subjects with the most macrophages demonstrated the greatest response to treatment. Adipose and muscle ω-3 fatty acid content increased after treatment; however, there was no change in insulin sensitivity or adiponectin. In vitro, M1-polarized macrophages expressed high levels of MCP-1. The addition of ω-3 fatty acids reduced MCP-1 expression with no effect on TNF-α. In addition, ω-3 fatty acids suppressed the upregulation of adipocyte MCP-1 that occurred when adipocytes were cocultured with macrophages. Thus, FO reduced adipose macrophages, increased capillaries, and reduced MCP-1 expression in insulin-resistant humans and in macrophages and adipocytes in vitro; however, there was no measureable effect on insulin sensitivity."

The effects of consuming novel soybean oils varying in LA:ALA ratios on T cell proliferation and inflammatory responses were assessed in older adults. Eighteen participants (>50 y old) with elevated cholesterol concentrations (3.37-4.14 mmol/L LDL cholesterol) consumed 5 experimental diets in random order for periods of 35 d. Each diet contained 30% of energy as fat, two-thirds of which was high-oleic acid soybean oil (HiOleic-SO), soybean oil (SO), low-SFA soybean oil (LoSFA-SO), hydrogenated soybean oil (Hydrog-SO), or low-ALA soybean oil (LoALA-SO), resulting in LA:ALA ratios of 2.98, 8.70, 9.69, 15.2, and 18.3, respectively. Participants had higher proliferative responses to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) compared with baseline following consumption of SO (26%; P < 0.05), LoSFA-SO (22%; P < 0.05), or HiOleic-SO (24%; P < 0.05) diets. Proliferative response was similar to the baseline after participants consumed diets with an LA:ALA ratio >10 (Hydrog-SO and LoALA-SO). Post-diet intervention, LA:ALA ratios correlated with proliferative responses to PHA (r = -0.87; P = 0.05). An optimal proliferative response was observed at an LA:ALA ratio of 8.70, with an inverse correlation between proliferative response and LA:ALA ratios >8.70. These effects were independent of changes in the production of PGE(2), inflammatory cytokines, or cytokines involved in growth of lymphocytes. These data suggest that the LA:ALA ratio modulates the proliferative ability of T lymphocytes, which may be due to subtle changes in fatty acid composition of the phospholipids in immune cells."

      "resumen": "Shorter telomeres have been associated with poor health behaviors, age-related diseases, and early mortality. Telomere length is regulated by the enzyme telomerase, and is linked to exposure to proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. In our recent randomized controlled trial, omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) supplementation lowered the concentration of serum proinflammatory cytokines. This study assessed whether n-3 PUFA supplementation also affected leukocyte telomere length, telomerase, and oxidative stress. In addition to testing for group differences, changes in the continuous n-6:n-3 PUFA ratio were assessed to account for individual differences in adherence, absorption, and metabolism. The double-blind four-month trial included 106 healthy sedentary overweight middle-aged and older adults who received (1) 2.5g/day n-3 PUFAs, (2) l.25g/day n-3 PUFAs, or (3) placebo capsules that mirrored the proportions of fatty acids in the typical American diet. Supplementation significantly lowered oxidative stress as measured by F2-isoprostanes (p=0.02). The estimated geometric mean log-F2-isoprostanes values were 15% lower in the two supplemented groups compared to placebo. Although group differences for telomerase and telomere length were nonsignificant, changes in the n-6:n-3 PUFA plasma ratios helped clarify the intervention's impact: telomere length increased with decreasing n-6:n-3 ratios, p=0.02. The data suggest that lower n-6:n-3 PUFA ratios can impact cell aging. The triad of inflammation, oxidative stress, and immune cell aging represents important pre-disease mechanisms that may be ameliorated through nutritional interventions. This translational research broadens our understanding of the potential impact of the n-6:n-3 PUFA balance. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00385723."

In this context, because the ingestion of (n-3) LC-PUFA may lower the concentrations of inflammatory biomarkers, we investigated whether the consumption of oily fish affects the levels of inflammatory cytokines and vascular adhesion factors during pregnancy. Pregnant women (n = 123) were randomly assigned to continue their habitual diet (control group, n = 61), which was low in oily fish, or to consume two 150-g salmon portions/wk (salmon group, n = 62; providing 3.45 g EPA plus DHA) from 20 wk of gestation until delivery. Plasma inflammatory cytokines and vascular adhesion factors were measured in maternal plasma samples. Inflammatory biomarkers, including IL-8, hepatocyte growth factor, and monocyte chemotactic protein, increased over the course of pregnancy (P < 0.001), whereas plasma matrix metalloproteinase 9, IL-6, TNFα, and nerve growth factor concentrations were not affected. Vascular homeostasis biomarkers soluble E-selectin, soluble vascular adhesion molecule-1, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1, and total plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 increased as pregnancy progressed (P < 0.001). The plasma sICAM-1 concentration was greater in the control group than in the salmon group at wk 20 (baseline) and 38 (P = 0.007) but there was no group x time interaction, and when baseline concentration was used as a covariate, the groups did not differ (P = 0.69). The remaining biomarkers analyzed were similar in both groups. Therefore, although some inflammatory and vascular homeostasis biomarkers change during pregnancy, they are not affected by the increased intake of farmed salmon."

A total of sixty-five women (mean age: 47·9 (SD 9·98) years) were studied in a 90-d parallel, randomised design. A control group maintained their usual diet; the second group received 29 g/d of soyabean (kinako); the third group received 3 g/d of fish oil n-3 fatty acids; and the fourth group received fish oil (3 g/d) and kinako (29 g/d). Anthropometric, blood pressure (BP), inflammatory markers, anti-inflammatory marker (adiponectin) and NO concentrations were evaluated. In relation to the baseline values, the group that received fish oil and kinako concomitantly presented a statistically significant decrease in systolic BP (SBP; P < 0·05), whereas there was a significant decrease in diastolic BP (DBP) in the control group (P < 0·05), kinako group (P < 0·01) and fish oil group (P < 0·01) after 90 d. There was a significant increase in adiponectin (P < 0·01) and NO values (P < 0·05) after 90 d in the kinako and fish oil groups. Differences between treatment groups verified a significant decrease (P < 0·05) in DBP in the kinako group after 90 d when compared to the results obtained from the fish oil and kinako groups. In conclusion, the findings of increased serum adiponectin and NO metabolite levels after 90 d, both in the fish oil and soya groups, reinforce the importance of the influence of adiponectin and NO levels on BP decrease in patients with the MetS."

This study aimed to determine the effects of high and low doses of (n-3) FA from plant and marine sources on plasma inflammatory marker concentrations. One-hundred adults with metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to a low or high dose of plant- (2.2 or 6.6 g/d α-linolenic acid) or marine- (1.2 or 3.6 g/d EPA and DHA) derived (n-3) FA or placebo for 8 wk, using a parallel arm design (n = 20/arm). Fasting blood samples collected at 0, 4, and 8 wk were analyzed for concentrations of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-6, and soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1) and for cardiovascular risk factors. Baseline concentrations across all 5 groups combined were (mean ± SD) 103 ± 32 ng/L for MCP-1, 1.06 ± 0.56 ng/L for IL-6, and 0.197 ± 0.041 ng/L for sICAM-1. There were no significant differences in 8-wk changes in plasma inflammatory marker concentrations among the 5 groups. Plasma TG and blood pressure decreased significantly more and the LDL cholesterol concentration increased more in the high-dose fish oil group compared to the 8-wk changes in some of the other 4 groups (P ≤ 0.04).

In this randomized, crossover study, 20 runners (11 men, 9 women, age 38.4 ± 2.1 yr) completed two 2-hr treadmill runs at 70% VO(2max) (3 wk apart). Subjects ingested either 4 quercetin-based chews (Q-chew) or placebo chews (PL) 15 min before the runs. The 4 Q-chews provided 1,000 mg quercetin, 120 mg epigallocatechin 3-gallate, 400 mg isoquercetin, 400 mg each eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, 1,000 mg vitamin C, and 40 mg niacinamide. Subjects provided blood samples 30 min before, immediately after, and 1 hr postexercise and were analyzed for plasma quercetin, total blood leukocytes (WBC), C-reactive protein (CRP), 9 cytokines (IL-6, TNFα, GM-CSF, IFNγ, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-8, IL-10, and IL-12p70), granulocyte (GR) and monocyte (MO) phagocytosis (PHAG), and oxidative-burst activity (OBA). Plasma quercetin increased from 80.0 ± 26.0 μg/L to 6,337 ± 414 μg/L immediately postexercise and 4,324 ± 310 μg/L 1 hr postexercise after ingestion of Q-chews, compared with no change in PL (p < .001). Exercise caused significant increases in, CRP, GM-CSF, IL-10, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, TNFα, GR-PHAG, and MO-PHAG and decreases in GR-OBA and MO-OBA, but no differences in the pattern of change were measured between Q-chew and PL trials. Acute ingestion of Q-chews 15 min before heavy exertion caused a strong increase in plasma quercetin levels but did not counter postexercise inflammation or immune changes relative to placebo."

      "resumen": "Chronic heart failure (CHF) is characterised by activation of neuroendocrine and inflammatory pathways, and both are linked to a prothrombotic state. Treatment with omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3-PUFA) showed significant benefits including mortality reduction in CHF, but exact mechanisms of action are still unclear. We investigated the effects of n3-PUFA on markers of platelet activation and thrombogenesis in patients with severe CHF. Thirty-six patients with non-ischaemic CHF (LVEF<35%, NYHA class>2) under optimised therapy were randomised to supplementation with 1g/day or 4 g/day n3-PUFA, or placebo for 12 weeks. Using whole-blood flow cytometry, monocyte-platelet aggregates characterised by CD14+/CD42b+ co-expression and monocytic tissue factor (TF) were determined. Plasma levels of P-selectin, sCD40L, fibrinogen, prothrombin fragment F1.2, TF and pro-inflammatory markers (high sensitive[hs] interleukin-6, hsCRP, hsTNF-alpha, monocyte chemotactic protein-1) were measured by immunoassay. Supplementation with 1g/day and 4 g/day n3-PUFA but not placebo significantly reduced monocyte-platelet aggregates in a dose-dependent manner (p for trend = 0.02 across the groups). A dose of 4 g/day but not 1g/day n3-PUFA significantly decreased P-selectin (p = 0.03). Plasma TF decreased dose-dependently upon n3-PUFA supplementation (p for trend = 0.02), paralleled by a significant decrease of TF+-monocytes (p for trend = 0.01). The amount of 4 g/day n3-PUFA exhibited modest anti-inflammatory effects with a significant reduction of hs interleukin-6 (p<0.01) and a trend-wise reduction of hsTNF-alpha (p = 0.09). No changes were seen for sCD40L, fibrinogen, hsCRP and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, while F1.2 was decreased by 4 g/day n3-PUFA (P = 0.03). In patients with severe non-ischaemic CHF, treatment with n3-PUFA leads to a dose-dependent decrease of platelet activation and TF. Higher dosage exhibits also anti-inflammatory effects."

      "resumen": "Observational studies have linked lower omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and higher omega-6 (n-6) PUFAs with inflammation and depression, but randomized controlled trial (RCT) data have been mixed. To determine whether n-3 decreases proinflammatory cytokine production and depressive and anxiety symptoms in healthy young adults, this parallel group, placebo-controlled, double-blind 12-week RCT compared n-3 supplementation with placebo. The participants, 68 medical students, provided serial blood samples during lower-stress periods as well as on days before an exam. The students received either n-3 (2.5 g/d, 2085 mg eicosapentaenoic acid and 348 mg docosahexanoic acid) or placebo capsules that mirrored the proportions of fatty acids in the typical American diet. Compared to controls, those students who received n-3 showed a 14% decrease in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated interleukin 6 (IL-6) production and a 20% reduction in anxiety symptoms, without significant change in depressive symptoms. Individuals differ in absorption and metabolism of n-3 PUFA supplements, as well as in adherence; accordingly, planned secondary analyses that used the plasma n-6:n-3 ratio in place of treatment group showed that decreasing n-6:n-3 ratios led to lower anxiety and reductions in stimulated IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) production, as well as marginal differences in serum TNF-α. These data suggest that n-3 supplementation can reduce inflammation and anxiety even among healthy young adults. The reduction in anxiety symptoms associated with n-3 supplementation provides the first evidence that n-3 may have potential anxiolytic benefits for individuals without an anxiety disorder diagnosis.

Extraction of teeth, including all premolars and molars, has been shown to be the therapy of choice in cats not responding sufficiently to home care (e.g. tooth brushing) and/or medical treatment (corticosteroids and/or antibiotics). In this study, we hypothesize that a cat food with an omega-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid (ω6 PUFA) to ω3 PUFA ratio of 10:1 reduces inflammation of the FCGS and accelerates soft tissue wound healing of the gingiva after dental extractions, compared to a cat food with a ω6:ω3 PUFA ratio of 40:1. The cats were fed diets with chicken fat and fish oil as sources of fatty acids. In one diet, part of the fish oil was replaced by safflower oil, resulting in two diets with ω6:ω3 PUFA ratios of 10:1 and 40:1. This double-blinded study in two groups of seven cats revealed that dietary fatty acids influence the composition of plasma cholesteryl esters and plasma levels of inflammatory cytokines. The diet with the 10:1 ratio lowered PGD(2) , PGE(2) and LTB(4) plasma levels significantly, compared to the diet with the 40:1 ratio (p = 0.05, p = 0.04, and p = 0.02 respectively). However, feeding diets with dietary ω6:ω3 PUFA ratios of 10:1 and 40:1, given to cats with FCGS for 4 weeks after extraction of all premolars and molars, did not alter the degree of inflammation or wound healing."

      "resumen": "Fibrates and omega-3 fatty acids have been used for many years in the treatment of increased triglyceride levels. Unfortunately, pleiotropic effects of these agents in patients with isolated hypertriglyceridaemia are poorly understood. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of bezafibrate and omega-3 fatty acids on monocyte cytokine release and systemic inflammation in this type of dyslipidaemia. The study included eighty-seven hypertriglyceridaemic subjects randomly allocated to one of three groups, treated respectively with bezafibrate (200 mg twice daily), omega-3 fatty acids (1 g twice daily) or placebo for 90 days. Eighty-three subjects completed the study. Apart from improvement in lipid profile, bezafibrate treatment reduced plasma high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels and inhibited monocyte release of interleukin-6, interleukin-1β, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and tumour necrosis factor-α. Bezafibrate action on plasma hsCRP and monocyte cytokine release was lipid-independent but correlated with drug-induced improvement in insulin sensitivity. Omega-3 fatty acids reduced plasma triglycerides, but did not induce any significant changes in monocyte secretory function and plasma hsCRP. Our study suggests that bezafibrate is superior to omega-3 fatty acids in reducing systemic inflammation and in producing monocyte-suppressing effects. Anti-inflammatory actions of bezafibrate may contribute to the clinical effectiveness of fibrates in the prevention and treatment of isolated hypertriglyceridaemia."

For alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which is the omega-3 fatty acid from plants, the relation to cardiovascular health is less clear. We reviewed the recent literature on dietary ALA intake, ALA tissue concentrations, and cardiovascular health in humans. Short-term trials (6-12 weeks) in generally healthy participants mostly showed no or inconsistent effects of ALA intake (1.2-3.6 g/d) on blood lipids, low-density lipoprotein oxidation, lipoprotein(a), and apolipoproteins A-I and B. Studies of ALA in relation to inflammatory markers and glucose metabolism yielded conflicting results. With regard to clinical cardiovascular outcomes, there is observational evidence for a protective effect against nonfatal myocardial infarction. However, no protective associations were observed between ALA status and risk of heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and sudden death. Findings from long-term trials of ALA supplementation are awaited to answer the question whether food-based or higher doses of ALA could be important for cardiovascular health in cardiac patients and the general population."

The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of an oral nutritional supplement containing (n-3) fatty acids on nutritional status and inflammatory markers in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) undergoing multimodality treatment. In a double-blind experiment, 40 patients with stage III NSCLC were randomly assigned to receive 2 cans/d of a protein- and energy-dense oral nutritional supplement containing (n-3) fatty acids (2.0 g EPA + 0.9 g DHA/d) or an isocaloric control supplement. EPA in plasma phospholipids, energy intake, resting energy expenditure (REE), body weight, fat free mass (FFM), mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC), and inflammatory markers were assessed. Effects of intervention were analyzed by generalized estimating equations and expressed as regression coefficients (B). The intervention group (I) had a better weight maintenance than the control (C) group after 2 and 4 wk (B = 1.3 and 1.7 kg, respectively; P < 0.05), a better FFM maintenance after 3 and 5 wk (B = 1.5 and 1.9 kg, respectively; P < 0.05), a reduced REE (B = -16.7% of predicted; P = 0.01) after 3 wk, and a trend for a greater MUAC (B = 9.1; P = 0.06) and lower interleukin-6 production (B = -27.9; P = 0.08) after 5 wk. After 4 wk, the I group had a higher energy and protein intake than the C group (B = 2456 kJ/24 h, P = 0.03 and B = 25.0 g, P = 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, a protein- and energy-dense oral nutritional supplement containing (n-3) fatty acids beneficially affects nutritional status during multimodality treatment in patients with NSCLC."

The authors recently reported a study in which fluoxetine and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which is an omega-3 fatty acid, appeared to be equally effective in controlling depressive symptoms and their combination was superior to either of them alone. Regulation of hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity and reduction of inflammatory cytokines are among several biological mechanisms which potentially explain the impact of omega-3 FAs on depression. In the present study, plasma cortisol and serum interleukin-1beta (IL-1 beta) and interleukin-6 (Il-6) were measured in patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder (MDD) participating in aforementioned trial to determine the effects of 8 weeks of treatment of depression with 1000 mg EPA alone or in combination with 20 mg fluoxetine on HPA axis activity and inflammatory cytokine production and compare the changes in these variables with those of treating with 20 mg fluoxetine alone. Forty-two patients were included in analysis. Two-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that plasma cortisol decreased significantly after 8 weeks of intervention without significant difference among the groups. There was no interaction between group and response to treatment over time in the cortisol response based on three-way ANOVA. Serum concentrations of IL-1beta and IL-6 did not change significantly after intervention. In conclusion, EPA alone or in combination with fluoxetine, as well as fluoxetine alone decreased serum cortisol after 8 weeks of treatment in patients with major depression disorder (MDD) without any significant effect of response to treatment. Serum IL-1beta and IL-6 did not change significantly after intervention. These findings suggest that EPA may exert its therapeutic effects through reduction of cortisol."

Marine n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( n-3 PUFA) may have anti-inflammatory effect and reduce levels of sCAMs (soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (sICAM-1), vascular adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1), P-selectin) and hsCRP. In a randomized, controlled trial, 138 patients with NYHA class II-III CHF were allocated to receive a daily supplement of 0.9 g of n-3 PUFA or olive oil for 24 weeks. After supplementation, no significant changes occurred in sCAMs or hsCRP after adjusting for possible confounders. However, a significant reduction was observed in sP-selectin in patients receiving n-3 PUFA, but this result was only of borderline significance in a between-group analysis. In conclusion, a daily supplement with 0.9 g of n-3 PUFA does not significantly affect plasma levels of sCAMs or hs-CRP in patients with CHF. n-3 PUFA may reduce sP-selectin, indicating a possible effect on platelet (and endothelial) activation. The results also indicate that the low dose of n-3 PUFA used in many intervention trials does not have deleterious effects on sCAMs or hsCRP."

Seventy-six patients with heart failure were randomly assigned to receive 2 g/day of n-3 PUFA or placebo for 3 months. Treatment with n-3 PUFA significantly decreased plasma levels of tumour necrosis factor, interleukin-6, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 and NT-proBNP. Left ventricular ejection fraction showed a small, non-significant improvement. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels decreased significantly in smokers after n-3 PUFA treatment.

      "resumen": "Fish consumption is associated with a reduced colorectal cancer risk. A possible mechanism by which fish consumption could decrease colorectal cancer risk is by reducing inflammation. However, thus far, intervention studies investigating both systemic and local gut inflammation markers are lacking. Our objective in this study was to investigate the effects of fatty and lean fish consumption on inflammation markers in serum, feces, and gut. In an intervention study, participants were randomly allocated to receive dietary advice (DA) plus either 300 g of fatty fish (salmon) or 300 g of lean fish (cod) per week for 6 mo, or only DA. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were measured pre- and postintervention (n = 161). In a subgroup (n = 52), we explored the effects of the fish intervention on fecal calprotectin and a wide range of cytokines and chemokines in fecal water and in colonic biopsies. Serum CRP concentrations were lower in the salmon (-0.5 mg/L; 95% CI -0.9, -0.2) and cod (-0.4 mg/L; 95% CI -0.7, 0.0) groups compared with the DA group. None of the inflammation markers in fecal water and colonic biopsies differed between the DA group and the groups that consumed extra fish. In conclusion, increasing salmon or cod consumption for 6 mo resulted in lower concentrations of the systemic inflammation marker CRP. However, exploratory analysis of local markers of inflammation in the colon or feces did not reveal an effect of fish consumption."

Our aim was to determine if dietary supplementation with a DHA-rich fish oil influenced the release of PGF(2alpha) from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). In the OmegAD study, 174 Alzheimer disease patients received either 1.7 g DHA plus 0.6 g EPA or a placebo daily for six months. PBMCs from the 21 (9 on fish oil and 12 on placebo) first-randomized patients were stimulated with either lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or phytohemagglutinin (PHA) before and after 6 months. Our results showed that plasma concentrations of DHA and EPA increased significantly at 6 months in the omega-3 group. PGF(2alpha) release from LPS- (but not from PHA-) stimulated PBMC was significantly diminished in this group; no change was noted in the placebo group. PGF(2alpha) changes correlated inversely with changes in plasma DHA and EPA. Decreased IL-6 and IL-1(beta) levels correlated with decreased PGF(2alpha) levels. The stimulus-specific PGF(2alpha) release from PBMC after 6 months of oral supplementation with the DHA-rich fish oil might be one event related to reduced inflammatory reactions associated with omega-3 fatty acid intake."

Blood and saliva samples were collected before and after the 6-wk supplementation period, immediately after the 3-hr exercise bout on the third day, and 14 hr postexercise and analyzed for various immune-function and inflammation parameters. Supplementation with n-3 PUFA resulted in a significant increase in plasma EPA and DHA but had no effect on 10-km time-trial performance; preexercise outcome measures; exercise-induced increases in plasma cytokines, myeloperoxidase, blood total leukocytes, serum C-reactive protein, and creatine kinase; or the decrease in the salivary IgA:protein ratio.

We randomized 51 patients in a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to receive either 2 capsules of Omacor twice daily or 2 capsules of placebo. Compliance was measured by determining levels of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in neutrophils. Plasma triglycerides were reduced in the n-3 PUFA group by 0.14 mmol/l after 12 weeks of treatment (n=26), while plasma triglycerides increased by 0.36 mmol/l in the control group (n=25). The difference between groups was significant, p=0.03. No significant effect of treatment was found for total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or apolipoproteins. There was a significant increase in leukotriene B5 (LTB5) and LTB5/LTB4 ratio in the n-3 PUFA group compared to the control group. Baseline values for intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM) and highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were comparable at baseline, and the intervention did not change these parameters significantly. The present study showed that treatment with n-3 PUFA slightly decreased plasma triglycerides and induced anti-inflammatory effects by increasing formation of anti-inflammatory LTB5."

Fasting concentrations of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and C-reactive protein (CRP), key inflammatory mediators, decrease after sustained n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) intake; however, the ability of n-3 PUFA to attenuate postprandial inflammatory responses is not well studied. Thus, we examined the acute effect of modifying the n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio of a high-saturated fatty acid (SFA) oral fat tolerance test (OFTT) on postprandial TAG and inflammatory responses in men with MetS. Men (n = 8, > or = 45 years old) with MetS ingested 2 high-SFA OFTTs (1 g fat per kilogram body weight), with either a 20:1 (low n-3) or 2:1 (high n-3) n-6/n-3 PUFA ratio, and a water control in a randomized crossover design. Blood samples were collected for 8 hours after treatment to measure postprandial TAG, free fatty acids, IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor, and CRP. Postprandial TAG increased at the same rate after ingestion of the low-n-3 and high-n-3 OFTTs; however, both OFTTs were significantly different from the water control. There were no differences in the rate at which IL-6 concentrations increased after ingestion of either of the OFTTs compared with water. Furthermore, neither time nor treatment affected circulating soluble IL-6 receptor or CRP concentrations. Thus, increasing the n-3 PUFA content of a high-SFA OFTT does not acutely change postprandial TAG or inflammatory responses in men with MetS."

      "resumen": "Inflammation plays a central role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis, and inflammatory markers have been reported to predict cardiovascular events. Mediterranean-like diet and very long chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation have been reported to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, but the mechanisms are not fully clarified. The aims of the present study were to investigate the effect of such interventions on serum levels of inflammatory markers, and potential associations with changes in serum fatty acids and anthropometric measures. This was a randomized 2 x 2 factorial-designed trial comparing the effect of 3 years of dietary counseling, n-3 PUFA supplementation (2.4 g/d), or both on different measures of atherosclerosis in elderly high-risk men (N = 563). Levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18) were decreased by diet (-10.5% vs baseline, P = .012 compared with no diet) and by n-3 PUFA supplementation (-9.9% vs baseline, P = .008 compared with placebo). Other measured inflammatory markers were not affected. Changes in IL-18 were significantly correlated to changes in triglycerides (r = 0.20, P < .001), eicosapentaenoic acid (r = -0.14, P = .030), docosahexaenoic acid (r = -0.14, P = .034), body mass index (r = 0.16, P < .001), and waist circumference (r = 0.12, P = .007). In conclusion, levels of IL-18 were significantly reduced by Mediterranean-like diet and n-3 PUFA supplementation. However, the changes correlated only weakly to changes in triglycerides, serum fatty acids, and anthropometric measures. The cardioprotective effects of both interventions might thus in part be explained by reduced levels of IL-18, but probably beyond changes in serum fatty acids and body composition."

Pregnant women with allergic disease in their immediate family were supplemented daily with 2.7 g omega-3 LCPUFA (n = 70) or 2.8 g soybean oil as placebo (n = 75) from the 25th gestational week. The proportions of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid in plasma/serum phospholipids increased in the omega-3-supplemented group, whereas arachidonic acid decreased during intervention. Lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 secretion from whole blood culture supernatants (n = 59) decreased in a majority of the omega-3-supplemented mothers (18 of 28, p = 0.002). The decreased prostaglandin E2 production was more pronounced among nonatopic than atopic mothers. The lipopolysaccharide-induced cytokine and chemokine secretion was not affected. Our results indicate that omega-3 LCPUFA supplementation during the last trimester may dampen certain immune responses involved in allergic inflammation."

Fifty-one older adults (65.4 +/- 0.8 years) were randomized to receive ALA in flax oil (~14 g.day-1) or placebo for 12 weeks while completing a resistance training program (3 days a week). Subjects were evaluated at baseline and after 12 weeks for muscle thickness of knee and elbow flexors and extensors (B-mode ultrasound), muscle strength (1 repetition maximum), body composition (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry), and concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-6. Males supplementing with ALA decreased IL-6 concentration over the 12 weeks (62 +/- 36% decrease; p = 0.003), with no other changes in inflammatory cytokines. Chest and leg press strength, lean tissue mass, muscle thickness, hip bone mineral content and density, and total bone mineral content significantly increased, and percent fat and total body mass decreased with training (p < 0.05), with the only benefit of ALA being a significantly greater increase in knee flexor muscle thickness in males (p < 0.05). Total-body bone mineral density improved in the placebo group, with no change in the ALA group (p = 0.05). ALA supplementation lowers the IL-6 concentration in older men but not women, but had minimal effect on muscle mass and strength during resistance training."

The effects were analyzed by the SIRS-related indexes. The results showed that APACHE-II scores in FO group were significantly lower, and the gap increased much farther after the 4th day than those in Con group (P<0.05). Fluid equilibrium time became shorter markedly in FO group than in Con group (5.1+/-2.2 days vs 8.4+/-2.3 days). In FO group, SIRS scores were markedly decreased and the SIRS state vanished after the 4th day; Plasma level of TNF-alpha was significantly reduced, while IL-10 decreased markedly, most prominently between the 4th and 7th day, and the ratio of IL-10/TNF-alpha raised as compared with Con group (P<0.05). During the initial stage of SAP, parenteral supplementation with omega-3 fish oil emulsion could efficiently lower the magnitude and persistence time of the SIRS, markedly retrieve the unbalance of the pro-/anti-inflammatory cytokines, improve severe condition of illness and may provide a new way to regulate the SIRS."

DHA supplementation for 45 and 91 d decreased the number of circulating neutrophils by 11.7 and 10.5%, respectively (P < 0.05). It did not alter the circulating concentrations of other inflammatory markers tested within 45 d, but at 91 d it reduced (P < 0.05) concentrations of C-reactive protein (CRP) by 15%, interleukin-6 by 23%, and granulocyte monocyte-colony stimulating factor by 21% and DHA increased the concentration of antiinflammatory matrix metalloproteinase-2 by 7%. The number of circulating neutrophils was positively associated with the weight percent (wt %) of 20:4(n-6) in RBC lipids, and negatively to the wt % of 20:5(n-3) and 22:6(n-3).

      "resumen": "Physiological events in the initial inflammatory stage of cutaneous wound healing influence subsequent stages. Proinflammatory cytokines coordinate molecular and cellular processes during the inflammatory stage. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) alter proinflammatory cytokine production, but how this phenomenon specifically influences wound healing is not clearly understood. In the present study, effects of marine-derived omega-3 eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic PUFA on proinflammatory cytokines in wound serum and time to complete healing in healthy, human skin were evaluated. We compared plasma fatty acid levels in two groups (N=30) at baseline and after 4 weeks of eicosapentaenoic/docosahexaenoic PUFA supplements (active) or placebo (control). Eight small blisters on participants' forearms were created. Proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha were quantified in blister fluid at 5 and 24 hours after creation. Wound area was calculated daily. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic plasma fatty acid levels were significantly higher in the active group. Additionally, we found significantly higher IL-1beta levels in blister fluid in the active group and time to complete wound closure was somewhat longer. These results suggest that eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic PUFA may increase proinflammatory cytokine production at wound sites and thus, depending on the clinical context, have noninvasive, therapeutic potential to affect cutaneous wound healing."

The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled. The proportion of EPA was significantly increased in plasma phosphatidylcholine (from 1.4% to 5.0% of total fatty acids; P<0.001), cholesteryl esters (from 1.2% to 4.5%; P<0.001) and triacylglycerols (from 0.3% to 1.8%; P<0.001). In contrast, the more modest increases in DHA in these lipid fractions were not significant. There was very little effect of n-3 fatty acids on the risk factors measured, apart from a reduction in plasma soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1 concentration compared with placebo (P=0.05). The change in plasma sICAM-1 concentration was significantly inversely related to the change in DHA in plasma phosphatidylcholine (r=-0.675; P=0.001), but less so to the change in EPA (r=-0.406; P=0.076). Data from the present study suggest that marine oil providing 1.8 g of EPA plus 0.3g DHA/day is not sufficient to demonstrate marked effects on cardiovascular risk factors (plasma lipids and inflammatory markers) in healthy middle-aged men, although there may be a slight anti-inflammatory effect as indicated by the decrease in sICAM-1. The stronger association between changes in DHA than EPA and sICAM-1 concentrations suggest that DHA may be more anti-inflammatory than EPA. Thus, one reason why only limited effects were seen here may be that the dose of DHA provided was insufficient."

      "resumen": "Under the common denomination of Systemic Immune-Metabolic Syndrome (SIMS), we grouped many symptoms that share a similar pathophysiologic background. SIMS is the result of the dysfunctional interaction of tumor cells, stroma cells, and the immune system, leading to the release of cytokines and other systemic mediators such as eicosanoids. SIMS includes systemic syndromes such as paraneoplastic hemopathies, hypercalcemia, coagulopathies, fatigue, weakness, cachexia, chronic nausea, anorexia, and early satiety among others. Eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic n-3 fatty acids from fish oil can help in the management of persistent chronic inflammatory states, but treatment's compliance is generally poor. Preferentially, Cox-2 inhibition can create a favorable pattern of cytokines by decreasing the production of certain eicosanoids, although their role in SIMS is unknown. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that by modulating systemic inflammation through an eicosanoid-targeted approach, some of the symptoms of the SIMS could be controlled. We exclusively evaluated 12 patients for compliance. Patients were assigned 1 of the 4 treatment groups (15-, 12-, 9-, or 6-g dose, fractionated every 8 h). For patients assigned to 15 and 12 doses, the overall compliance was very poor and unsatisfactory for patients receiving the 9-g dose. The maximum tolerable dose was calculated to be around 2 capsules tid (6 g of fish oil per day). A second cohort of 22 patients with advanced lung cancer and SIMS were randomly assigned to receive either fish oil, 2 g tid, plus placebo capsules bid (n = 12) or fish oil, 2 g tid, plus celecoxib 200 mg bid (n = 10). All patients in both groups received oral food supplementation. After 6 wk of treatment, patients receiving fish oil + placebo or fish oil + celecoxib showed significantly more appetite, less fatigue, and lower C-reactive protein (C-RP) values than their respective baselines values (P < 0.02 for all the comparisons). Additionally, patients in the fish oil + celecoxib group also improved their body weight and muscle strength compared to baseline values (P < 0.02 for all the comparisons). Comparing both groups, patients receiving fish oil + celecoxib showed significantly lower C-RP levels (P = 0.005, t-test), higher muscle strength (P = 0.002, t-test) and body weight (P = 0.05, t-test) than patients receiving fish oil + placebo. The addition of celecoxib improved the control of the acute phase protein response, total body weight, and muscle strength. Additionally, the consistent nutritional support used in our patients could have helped to maximize the pharmacological effects of fish oil and/or celecoxib. This study shows that by modulating the eicosanoid metabolism using a combination of n-3 fatty acids and cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor, some of the signs and symptoms associated with a SIMS could be ameliorated."

Peripheral blood was collected at 2 and 6 weeks to measure immune cell response (the rate of [3H]thymidine uptake and cytokine production after stimulation with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)). Compared with cells from infants receiving only human milk (HM), the rate of [3H]thymidine uptake in response to PHA, but not IL-2 production, was lower for Formula+LCP infants (P < 0.05). Compared with HM-fed infants, Formula-fed infants (but not Formula+LCP infants) produced more TNF-alpha (unstimulated) and had a fewer CD3+CD44+ cells before stimulation and fewer CD11c+ cells post-stimulation (P < 0.05). However, compared with Formula-fed infants, the Formula+LCP infants had an immune cell distribution (higher percentage CD3+CD44+ and CD4+CD28+ cells) and cytokine profile (lower production of TNF-alpha post-stimulation) that did not differ from HM infants. Additionally, it was found that feeding infants formula during the first 10 d of life influenced immune function. These infants had a higher percentage of CD3+, CD4+CD28+, and lower percentage of CD14+ cells and produced more TNF-alpha and interferon-gamma after PHA stimulation than HM-fed infants (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that early diet influences both the presence of specific cell types and function of infant blood immune cells. Since many diseases have a strong immunological component, these immune changes may be of physiological importance to the developing infant."

      "resumen": "CVD is associated with a cellular inflammatory/immune response. n-3 PUFA and moderate aerobic exercise independently alter cytokine production and leucocyte function. There is limited evidence for the combined effect of these treatments on immune function, particularly in patients with risk factors for CVD. We hypothesised that exercise would enhance the anti-inflammatory effects of n-3 PUFA. In a randomised, placebo-controlled study, fifty volunteers were allocated double-blind to consume either sunflower oil (6 g/d, placebo) or DHA-rich fish oil (6 g/d; about 2 g n-3 PUFA; 1.6 g DHA /d) for 12 weeks. Volunteers were further randomised to undertake regular exercise (walking 3 d/week for 45 min at 75 % of maximum heart rate) or maintain their usual physical activity for 12 weeks. Immune functions were assessed in blood taken initially and after 12 weeks. There was no effect on cytokine production by T cells and monocytes. Superoxide anion production from stimulated blood neutrophils was decreased by fish oil (19.5 (sem 8.5) %, P = 0.016) but not by exercise, and this change was negatively correlated with the incorporation of DHA into erythrocytes (r-0.385, P = 0.047). Participation in regular exercise maintained neutrophil bactericidal activity, which decreased in non-exercising subjects (2.9 (sem 0.7) %, P = 0.013). Neutrophil chemotaxis and adherence were not significantly affected by exercise, oil, or the combination of the two. Thus the combination of moderate exercise and fish-oil supplementation, which reduces cardiovascular risk, may also help to counteract inflammation."

Thirty apparently healthy males and females were recruited from the general public in Melbourne, Australia to participate in a double blind, randomised, parallel intervention study. Subjects were consuming approximately 73 mg of omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 LCPUFA) daily in their background diet prior to the commencement of the intervention. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume either 2 mL/day of the NZGLM oil preparation (mixed with olive oil and dl-alpha-tocopherol) or fish oil preparation (also mixed with olive oil and dl-alpha-tocopherol) for six weeks. Two mL of the oils contained 241 mg and 181 mg of n-3 LCPUFA, respectively. Neutrophil phospholipid fatty acids, serum thromboxane B2 (TXB2), stimulated monocyte production of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) were measured. During the intervention, the total intakes of n-3 LCPUFA from the background diet and the supplements were 199 mg/d and 173 mg/day for the NZGLM and FO groups, respectively. Following six weeks of supplementation, both groups showed a small, but significant increase in neutrophil phospholipid proportion of eicosapentaenoic acid. The NZGLM group also showed a significant increase in docosahexaenoic acid levels. There were no significant changes with time or treatment for TXB2, PGE2, IL-1 beta or TNFalpha. This study showed that low dose supplementation with n-3 LCPUFA from two different marine oil preparations showed no difference in inflammatory markers in this group of healthy individuals. Further studies are warranted including dose response trials and studies in populations with inflammatory conditions."

The cardioprotective effects of omega-3 fatty acids have been documented in epidemiologic and randomized controlled trials. These fatty acids are presumed to decrease susceptibility to fatal arrhythmias, but whether this is mediated by classic risk factors or direct cardiac mechanisms is not known. Eighteen white men with a history of myocardial infarction and ejection fractions <40% were randomized to placebo or omega-3 fatty acids (585 mg of docosahexaenoic acid and 225 mg of eicosapentaenoic acid) for two 4-month periods in a crossover design. At the end of each period, heart rate (HR), HR variability, and rate of HR recovery after exercise were determined, as were effects on arterial compliance, blood pressure, cardiac function, and fasting serum levels of lipids and inflammatory markers. Omega-3 fatty acids decreased HR at rest from 73 +/- 13 to 68 +/- 13 beats/min (p <0.0001) and improved 1-minute HR recovery after exercise (-27 +/- 10 to -32 +/- 12 beats/min, p <0.01). HR variability in the high-frequency band increased (p <0.02), but no change was noted in overall HR variability. There were no significant effects on blood pressure, arterial compliance, lipids, or inflammatory markers. These changes are consistent with an increase in vagal activity and may in part explain the observed decrease in risk for sudden cardiac death seen with omega-3 fatty acid supplementation."

      "resumen": "COPD, the fifth-leading cause of death worldwide, is characterized by chronic inflammation. However, no available agent can effectively cure this inflammation. A dietary supplement containing omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) has anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we hypothesized that nutritional support with omega-3 PUFA-rich diets may be useful for treating COPD, and we compared the clinical features and inflammatory mediator levels between the COPD patients who received an omega-3 PUFA-rich supplement and those who received a nonrich supplement."

      "resumen": "The ex vivo production of inflammatory cytokines during fish oil supplementation (n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, n-3 PUFA) is a matter of considerable controversy. Studies on human subjects have generally reported decreased lymphocyte proliferation and decreased production of IL-2, interferon-gamma, IL-1beta, IL-6 and TNF-alpha, but other studies showed no effect or even increased production. There are no published reports on ex vivo cytokine production in children on long-term, n-3 PUFA supplementation. The current double-blind study explored cytokine production by peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation in children on 12 weeks' supplementation with 300 mg/day of n-3 PUFA. Twenty-one children (aged 8-12 years) were randomized to receive 1 g canola oil (control) or 300 mg n-3 PUFA + 700 mg canola oil in a chocolate spread. Blood was then drawn and PBMCs were separated and cultured for 24 h in a culture medium with or without 10 microg/mL LPS for 5 x 10(6) PBMCs. The pro-inflammatory cytokines, IL-1beta, TNF-alpha and IL-6, and the anti-inflammatory cytokines, IL-10 and IL-1RA, were evaluated by ELISA. The levels of all the cytokines were higher in non-stimulated and LPS-stimulated cultures, from n-3 PUFA-treated subjects as compared to controls. There was no difference in the IL-1beta/IL-1RA ratio between the two groups, with and without LPS stimulation. Nevertheless, the ratio tended to be lower in the treated subjects on both occasions. In conclusion, our results indicate an increased production of both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, with and without LPS stimulation, in children on 12 weeks' n-3 PUFA supplementation."

      "resumen": "Polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) immunomodulatory properties have been studied extensively in chronic infections. Few studies have focused on acute infection; thus, PUFA effects in a mouse model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA)-induced lung injury were evaluated. C57BL/6 mice were randomized to be fed for 3 wk with an eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) diet, an arachidonic acid (AA) diet, or a control diet [saturated fatty acids]. Lung injury was induced by intratracheal instillation of 10(7) CFU of PA per mouse. In each diet group, animals were studied either without or after PA-inducing lung injury. Evaluation criteria were early mortality; inflammatory response assessed with tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), IL-1beta, IL-6 and IL-10 levels in bronchoalveolar lavage; lung injury evaluation; and extravascular lung water, assessed 24 h after the injury. After PA-induced lung injury, no difference in early mortality was observed; TNF-alpha level was significantly higher in the EPA diet than in the other two diet groups. No difference for the other cytokines was found among the groups. Lung edema was also more important in the EPA group, consistent with the variations of TNF-alpha levels. Our study clearly shows that in PA-induced acute lung injury, n-3 PUFA induces differences in the inflammatory response with a higher level of lung edema. Modulation of the inflammatory response with n-3 PUFA can influence the response to a bacterial challenge."

We assessed whether this may be mediated by reduced ultraviolet-B (UV-B) induction of proinflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-6, IL-8 and prostaglandin (PG)E(2) in healthy skin. In a double-blind, randomized study, 28 humans received 4 g daily of 95% ethyl esters of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or oleic acid (OA) orally for 3 months. Skin biopsies and suction blister fluid were taken from unexposed and UV-B-exposed skin and examined for mediator expression immunohistochemically and quantitatively by immunoassay; plasma levels were also assayed. The subjects taking EPA, but not OA, showed a significant rise in their minimal erythemal dose (MED) (data reported elsewhere). Before supplementation, irradiation with 3x MED UV-B increased blister fluid TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8 and PGE(2) at 16 h (all P < 0.001). No significant change occurred in baseline or UV-B-induced skin levels of cytokines after either supplement, whereas UV-B induction of PGE(2) was abolished after EPA but not OA. Immunohistochemical expression of the cytokines at baseline and after UV-B was unaltered by EPA and OA; circulating cytokine and PGE(2) levels were also unchanged. Hence, in healthy skin in vivo, there was no evidence that reduction of the sunburn response by EPA is mediated by the proinflammatory cytokines examined; abrogation of UV-B-generated PGE(2) may play a role."

While both omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n3PUFA) and the lipid-soluble antioxidant alpha-tocopherol (AT) have been shown to independently have significant anti-inflammatory effects, there is paucity of data examining the effect of n3PUFA alone and in combination with AT on markers of inflammation and monocyte function. Therefore, we tested the effect of n3PUFA alone, all-rac (synthetic) AT alone, and the combination on markers of inflammation and monocyte function. Healthy nonsmoking volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 groups (n = 20 per group): 1.5 g/d n3PUFA, 800 IU/d AT, 1.5 g n3PUFA + 800 IU/d AT, or placebo in a parallel double-blinded study. Compared to baseline, 12 weeks of supplementation resulted in no changes in plasma lipids regardless of treatment. Plasma AT was significantly increased only in those groups that received AT (P <.0001). Similarly, groups receiving n3PUFA showed a significant increase in plasma docosahexaenoic acid (P <.0001). No significant within- or between-group differences were found for plasma levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Furthermore, there were no differences in monocyte proinflammatory cytokine release (interleukin [IL]-1beta, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha and IL-6) after activation with monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1). In conclusion, supplementation with n3PUFA and all-rac AT at these doses is not anti-inflammatory."

      "resumen": "n-3 fatty acids reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease via a number of possible mechanisms. Despite this, there has been concern that these fatty acids may increase lipid peroxidation. The data in vivo are inconclusive, due in part to limitations in the methodologies. In this regard, the measurement of F2-isoprostanes provides a reliable assessment of in vivo lipid peroxidation and oxidant stress. This study aimed to assess the effects of supplementation with purified eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) or docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), the two major n-3 fatty acids, on urinary F2-isoprostanes and markers of inflammation, in type 2 diabetic patients. In a double-blind, placebo controlled trial of parallel design, 59 nonsmoking, treated-hypertensive, type 2 diabetic subjects, were randomized to 4 g daily of purified EPA, DHA, or olive oil for 6 weeks, while maintaining their usual diet. F2-isoprostanes, measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry in 24 h urines and C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), were measured before and after intervention. Thirty-nine men and 12 women aged 61.2 +/- 1.2 years, with body mass index (BMI), 29.5 +/- 0.5 kg/m2; 24 h blood pressure, 138/73 mmHg; HbA1c, 7.3 +/- 0.1% and fasting glucose, 7.9 +/- 0.2 mmol/l completed the intervention. Baseline urinary F2-isoprostanes were positively associated with HbA1c (p=.011) and fasting glucose (p=.032). Relative to the olive oil group, postintervention urinary F2-isoprostanes were decreased 19% by EPA (p=.017) and 20% by DHA (p=.014). There were no significant changes in CRP, IL-6, and TNF-alpha following EPA or DHA supplementation. In regression analysis, Delta F2-isoprostanes were positively associated with Delta HbA1c (p=.007) independent of treatment group; and with Delta TNF-alpha (p=.034) independent of age, gender, BMI, and treatment group. There were no associations with Delta CRP or Delta IL-6. This study is the first report demonstrating that either EPA or DHA reduce in vivo oxidant stress without changing markers of inflammation, in treated hypertensive, type 2 diabetic subjects."

      "resumen": "Potential impact of omega-3 fatty acids, as contained in fish oil, on immunological function has been suggested because observations of reduced inflammatory diseases in Greenland Inuit were published. A fish oil-based lipid emulsion has recently been approved for parenteral nutrition in many countries. We investigated the influence of a short infusion course of fish oil-based (omega-3) vs conventional (omega-6) lipid emulsion on monocyte function. In a randomized design, twelve healthy volunteers received omega-3 or omega-6 lipid infusion for 48 h, with cross-over repetition of the infusion course after 3 mo. Fatty acid profiles, monocyte cytokine release and adhesive monocyte-endothelium interaction were investigated. Resultant omega-6 lipid emulsion increased plasma-free fatty acids including arachidonic acid, whereas the omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid ratio in monocyte membranes remained largely unchanged. It also caused a tendency toward enhanced monocyte proinflammatory cytokine release and adhesive monocyte-endothelium interaction. In contrast, omega-3 lipid emulsion significantly increased the omega-3/omega-6 fatty acid ratio in the plasma-free fatty acid fraction and in monocyte membrane lipid pool, markedly suppressing monocyte generation of TNF-alpha, IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in response to endotoxin. In addition, it also significantly inhibited both monocyte-endothelium adhesion and transendothelial monocyte migration, although monocyte surface expression of relevant adhesive molecules (CD11b, CD18, CD49 days, CCR2) was unchanged. Although isocaloric, omega-3 and omega-6 lipid emulsions exert differential impact on immunological processes in humans. In addition to its nutritional value, fish oil-based omega-3 lipid emulsion significantly suppresses monocyte proinflammatory cytokine generation and features of monocyte recruitment."

      "resumen": "Studies on animal and human subjects have shown that greatly increasing the amount of linseed (also known as flaxseed) oil (rich in the n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) alpha-linolenic acid (ALNA)) or fish oil (FO; rich in the long-chain n-3 PUFA eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)) in the diet can decrease a number of markers of immune function. The immunological effects of more modest doses of n-3 PUFA in human subjects are unclear, dose-response relationships between n-3 PUFA supply and immune function have not been established and whether ALNA has the same effects as its long-chain derivatives is not known. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to determine the effect of enriching the diet with different doses of FO or with a modest dose of ALNA on a range of functional responses of human monocytes and lymphocytes. In a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel study, forty healthy males aged 18-39 years were randomised to receive placebo or 3.5 g ALNA/d or 0.44, 0.94 or 1.9 g (EPA+DHA)/d in capsules for 12 weeks. The EPA:DHA ratio in the FO used was 1.0:2.5. ALNA supplementation increased the proportion of EPA but not DHA in plasma phospholipids. FO supplementation decreased the proportions of linoleic acid and arachidonic acid and increased the proportions of EPA and DHA in plasma phospholipids. The interventions did not alter circulating mononuclear cell subsets or the production of tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL) 1beta, IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 or interferon-gamma by stimulated mononuclear cells. There was little effect of the interventions on lymphocyte proliferation. The two higher doses of FO resulted in a significant decrease in IL-6 production by stimulated mononuclear cells. It is concluded that, with the exception of IL-6 production, a modest increase in intake of either ALNA or EPA+DHA does not influence the functional activity of mononuclear cells. The threshold of EPA+DHA intake that results in decreased IL-6 production is between 0.44 and 0.94 g/d."

      "resumen": "Infusion of fish oil-based (n-3) lipids may influence leukocyte function and plasma lipids in critical care patients. Twenty-one patients with sepsis requiring parenteral nutrition were randomized to receive an n-3 lipid emulsion rich in eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid or a conventional (n-6) lipid emulsion (index fatty acid: arachidonic acid) for 5 days. The impact on plasma-free fatty acids, mononuclear leukocyte cytokine generation, and membrane fatty acid composition was examined. Cytokine synthesis by isolated mononuclear leukocyte was elicited by endotoxin. Before the onset of lipid infusion therapy, plasma-free fatty acid concentrations were greatly increased in septic patients, with arachidonic acid by far surpassing eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid, a feature maintained during conventional lipid infusion. Within 2 days of fish oil infusion, free n-3 fatty acids increased, and the n-3/n-6 ratio was reversed, with rapid incorporation of n-3 fatty acids into mononuclear leukocyte membranes. Generation of proinflammatory cytokines by mononuclear leukocytes was markedly amplified during n-6 and was suppressed during n-3 lipid application. After termination of lipid administration, free n-3 fatty acid concentrations and mononuclear leukocyte cytokine synthesis returned to preinfusion values. Use of lipid infusions might allow us to combine intravenous alimentation with differential impact on inflammatory events and immunologic functions in patients with sepsis."

      "resumen": "We have investigated the effect of fish oil supplementation on the association between serum non-esterified fatty acid (NEFA) pattern and atherosclerotic activity. We studied correlations between serum non-esterified very long-chain eicosapentaenoic (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (AA) and biochemical markers of endothelial activation before and after 18-months intervention with fish oil supplementation. The fish oil supplementation consisted of 2.4 g of EPA and DHA per day, with corn oil as placebo. Elderly men ( n =171) with high risk for coronary heart disease were divided into four intervention groups in a factorial design: fish oil supplementation ( n =44), dietary intervention ( n =42), fish oil supplementation+dietary intervention ( n =47) or placebo ( n =38). The composition of fasting NEFA was analysed before and after intervention by GLC. Circulating endothelial markers were analysed by ELISA. A statistically significant positive correlation between the change in serum non-esterified DHA and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (sVCAM-1) was found in the pooled group that received fish oil supplementation ( n =91; Spearman's correlation coefficient r =0.24, P =0.02). No such correlation was found in the pooled group without fish oil supplementation ( n =80). Furthermore, there was a significant negative correlation between the change in serum non-esterified EPA and the relative change in sVCAM-1 in the group that did not receive fish oil supplementation ( r =-0.34, P =0.002). No such correlation was found in the group with fish oil supplementation. We conclude that large increase in serum non-esterified EPA and DHA, which can only be attained by supplementation, might increase inflammation in vascular endothelium. A moderate dietary increase in fish oil intake may, however, have an effect on decreasing inflammatory markers."

The grade of GVHD after transplantation was compared with that estimated from the pretransplantation LTB4 level. The levels of LTB4 and several cytokines were also monitored. The actual grade of GVHD was lower than that estimated from LTB4 levels in three of the eight patients from the treated group, and there was a significant difference between the treated and untreated groups (p < 0.05, chi 2 test). The levels of LTB4, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) were all significantly lower in the treated group (p < 0.05, Student's t-test). These findings suggest that eicosapentaenoic acid may ameliorate acute colonic GVHD when administered from before BMT."

      "resumen": "According to the model of \"response to injury,\" the arterial endothelium is occasionally injured in hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and in other states known as risk factors. The ensuing inflammatory response is modulated by cytokines and growth factors, among them platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1). In two independent studies, we demonstrated that mRNA levels for PDGF-A and -B and for MCP-1 are reduced after ingestion of n-3 fatty acids by human volunteers. This reduction persists after monocyte stimulation/differentiation by adherence. Moreover, the reduction is brought about only by dietary n-3 fatty acids and not by other classes of unsaturated fatty acids (n-6 or n-9). This appears to be one major mechanism of action of reduced progression/increased regression of established coronary artery disease by ingestion of 1.5 g/d n-3 fatty acids, as assessed by coronary angiography in a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind intervention study in 223 patients. The study was conducted according to \"Good Clinical Practice,\" comprehensive rules regulating investigations with pharmaceutical compounds. Together, our investigations lend support to the importance of PDGF-A, PDGF-B, and MCP-1 in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis, and the beneficial role of n-3 fatty acids therein."

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of dietary supplementation with moderate levels of ALNA, gamma-linolenic acid (GLA), arachidonic acid (ARA), DHA, or FO on inflammatory cell numbers and functions and on circulating levels of soluble adhesion molecules. Healthy subjects aged 55 to 75 yr consumed nine capsules per day for 12 wk. The capsules contained placebo oil (an 80:20 mix of palm and sunflowerseed oils) or blends of placebo oil with oils rich in ALNA, GLA, ARA, or DHA or FO. Subjects in these groups consumed 2 g ALNA; approximately 700 mg GLA, ARA, or DHA; or 1 g EPA plus DHA (720 mg EPA + 280 mg DHA) daily from the capsules. Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g per day. None of the treatments affected inflammatory cell numbers in the bloodstream; neutrophil and monocyte phagocytosis or respiratory burst in response to E. coli; production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1beta, and interleukin-6 in response to bacterial lipopolysaccharide; or plasma concentrations of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1. In contrast, the ALNA and FO treatments decreased the plasma concentrations of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (16 and 28% decrease, respectively) and soluble E-selectin (23 and 17% decrease, respectively). It is concluded that, in contrast to previous reports using higher amounts of these fatty acids, a moderate increase in consumption of long-chain n-6 or n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids does not significantly affect inflammatory cell numbers or neutrophil and monocyte responses in humans and so would not be expected to cause immune impairment. Furthermore, we conclude that moderate levels of ALNA and FO, which could be incorporated into the diet, can decrease some markers of endothelial activation and that this mechanism of action may contribute to the reported health benefits of n-3 fatty acids."

This study was conducted to determine whether blocking the etiologic factors of SIRS could improve the complications of BMT. Sixteen consecutive patients with unrelated donors were allocated alternately to two groups. Seven patients received 1.8 g/day of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) orally from 3 weeks before to about 180 days after transplantation, while nine patients did not. These two groups were compared with respect to complications, survival, and various cytokines and factors causing vascular endothelial damage. All seven patients receiving EPA survived and only two had grade III graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Among the nine patients not receiving EPA, three had grade III or IV GVHD. In addition, thrombotic microangiopathy developed in four patients and cytomegalovirus disease occurred in four. Five patients died in this group. The levels of leukotriene B(4), thromboxane A(2), and prostaglandin I(2) were significantly lower in patients receiving EPA than in those not receiving it (all P < 0.01). Cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, and interleukin-10 were also significantly decreased by EPA (P < 0.05), as were factors causing vascular endothelial damage such as thrombomodulin and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (P < 0.05). The survival rate was significantly higher in the group given EPA (P < 0.01). EPA significantly reduced the complications of BMT, indicating that these complications may be manifestations of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome."

They decrease the release of 5HT by platelets and possess vasorelaxant activity. This led them to be tried in the prophylactic treatment of migraine. After 4 weeks of a single-blind placebo run-in period, patients were randomized and treated in double-blind condition by placebo or OPFA 6 g a day for 16 weeks, followed by a 4-week placebo run-out period. The intention to treat population included 196 patients. Those who received all four treatment periods included 96 patients taking OPFA and 87 taking placebo. The primary efficacy analysis was the number of migraine attacks during the last 4 weeks of treatment. During this period, the mean number of attacks was 1.20 +/- 1.40 in the OPFA group and 1.26 +/- 1.11 in the placebo group (NS). The total number of attacks during the 4-month period of the study was significantly different between groups: 7.05 in the placebo group, 5.95 in the OPFA group (P = 0.036). Mean intensity, mean duration of the attacks and rescue medication use, were not significantly different between the two groups. Except for a significant difference against OPFA for eructations, the tolerance was satisfying. Despite a run-in placebo period of 1 month, a very strong placebo effect was observed in this trial: 45% reduction of the attacks between run-in and 4-month treatment period (55% in the OPFA group, P = 0.058). Finally, this large study did not confirm two previous studies based on a small number of patients."

Total fat intake from the capsules was 4 g/d. The fatty acid composition of PBMC phospholipids was significantly changed in the GLA, ARA, DHA and FO groups. Lymphocyte proliferation was not significantly affected by the placebo, ALNA, ARA or DHA treatments. GLA and FO caused a significant decrease (up to 65%) in lymphocyte proliferation. This decrease was partly reversed by 4 wk after stopping the supplementation. None of the treatments affected the production of interleukin-2 or interferon-gamma by PBMC and none of the treatments affected the number or proportion of T or B lymphocytes, helper or cytotoxic T lymphocytes or memory helper T lymphocytes in the circulation.

Blood samples were collected before the race, immediately after, and 1.5 and 3 h postexercise. The fatty acid composition in blood mononuclear cells (BMNC) differed between the fish oil-supplemented and the control group, showing incorporation of n-3 PUFA and less arachidonic acid in BMNC in the supplemented group. The plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-6, and transforming growth factor-beta(1) peaked immediately after the run, the increase being 3-, 92-, and 1.1-fold, respectively, compared with resting samples. The level of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist peaked 1.5 h after exercise, with the increase being 87-fold. However, the cytokine levels did not differ among the two groups. Furthermore, supplementation with fish oil did not influence exercise-induced increases in leucocytes and creatine kinase. In conclusion, 6 wk of fish oil supplementation had no influence on the acute-phase response to strenuous exercise."

      "resumen": "There is some evidence that intake of sea food rich in n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) may protect against coronary heart disease (CHD). Thus, even very low daily amounts of n-3 PUFA below 0.5 g have been reported to reduce the incidence of CHD, although it is unknown by what mechanisms this may occur. Monocytes are of major importance in atherogenesis, and we therefore studied the effect of a daily supplement with 0.65 g of n-3 PUFA for 12 weeks on monocyte function in a randomized placebo-controlled trial of 32 healthy subjects. No effect of dietary n-3 PUFA could be demonstrated on monocyte chemotaxis, on chemiluminescence, or on formation of cytokines and leukotriene B4 from activated monocytes."

      "resumen": "T-cell activation and cytokine production play an important role in several chronic inflammatory diseases. Because n-3 fatty acids exert beneficial effects on the clinical state of some of these diseases, we examined the effect of dietary supplementation of n-3 fatty acids on T-cell proliferation, expression of CD25 (interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain), secretion of interleukin-2, interleukin-6 and tumour necrosis factor from T-cells from patients with psoriasis and atopic dermatitis. During 4 months, 21 patients supplied 6 g of highly concentrated ethyl esters of EPA and DHA in gelatin capsules daily to their diet. In the control group 20 patients supplied 6 g per day of corn oil in gelatin capsules to their diet. Eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5, n-3) of serum phospholipids increased from 14 (min 4-max 42) to 81 (min 59-max 144) mg l-1 (P < 0.01) in patients with atopic dermatitis receiving n-3 fatty acids, and from 25 (min 7-max 66) to 74 (min 46-max 142) mg l-1 (P < 0.01) in patients with psoriasis, whereas docosahexaenoic acid (22:6, n-3) increased from 65 (min 46-max 120) to 92 (min 54-max 121) mg l-1 (P < 0.05) and from 81 (min 38-max 122) to 92 (min 63-max 169) mg l-1 (NS) in atopic and psoriatic patients, respectively. The changes in the serum phospholipid fatty acid profile in the groups receiving n-3 fatty acids, correlate to the dietary intake of corresponding fatty acids.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

      "resumen": "In several studies diets supplemented with fish oil containing a high proportion of omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids (w-3-PUFA) have been shown to produce beneficial effects, such as a reduction in blood pressure, lipid levels and inflammation, all of which may affect the course of IgA nephropathy. However, the results of hitherto published studies concerning IgA nephropathy have been inconclusive. We therefore carried out a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled six-month study with a higher daily dose of w-3-PUFA than used in previous studies. Thirty-two adult patients with biopsy-proven IgA nephropathy and proteinuria completed the study: 15 were assigned to a fish-oil product with a high percentage of w-3-PUFA (K 85, with 55% eicosapentenoic and 30% docosahexenoic acid) and 17 to corn oil, 6g daily of either oil. At the start, no significant differences were found between the two groups (K85: 3 females/12 males, mean age 39 years (range 22-64), corn oil: 4 females/13 males, age 42 years (range 26-68). By six months, supplements of K85 resulted in a slight but significant reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) compared to the start: 51Cr-EDTA: 63 +/- 22 to 59 +/- 21 ml/min/1.73 m2 (p < 0.05), creatinine clearance: 91 +/- 31 to 79 +/- 25 ml/min (p < 0.01), s-creatinine: 131 +/- 39 to 139 +/- 39 mumol/l, whereas no change in GFR was observed in the corn oil group. The urinary total protein and red blood cell excretions were not affected in any of the groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

      "resumen": "The effects of dietary supplementation with n-3 fatty acids on the level of cytokines and complement activation in plasma from patients with rheumatoid arthritis were examined. Thirty-two patients with active rheumatoid arthritis were included in a 12-week double-blind, randomized study of dietary supplementation with n-3 fatty acids (3.6 g per day) or placebo. The cytokines were measured in plasma before and after treatment with fish oil or placebo. In general, cytokine values at the upper limits of the calculated normal areas were found. The Interleukin-1 beta concentration in plasma was reduced significantly after 12 weeks of dietary supplementation with fish oil (p < 0.03). No significant difference was observed in the placebo group. The tumour necrosis factor alpha activity in plasma did not change significantly (p = 0.167). No significant changes were observed in the degree of complement activation. The clinical status of the patients was improved in the fish oil group, but not in the placebo group, judged by Ritchie's articular index (p < 0.02). We conclude that dietary supplementation with n-3 fatty acids results in significantly reduced plasma IL-1 beta levels in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Even though the cytokine levels were low, the anti-inflammatory effect of n-3 fatty acids could in part be explained by their ability to decrease cytokine production."
